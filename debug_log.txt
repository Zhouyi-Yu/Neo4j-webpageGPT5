The design procedure starts with modeling the parallel HEV as a systematic control-oriented model and defining a cost function. Fuzzy encoding and nearest neighbor approaches are proposed to achieve velocity prediction, and a finite-state Markov chain is exploited to learn transition probabilities of power demand. To determine the optimal control behaviors and power distribution between two energy sources, a novel RL-based energy management strategy is introduced.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been presented as alternative to conventional methods (e.g., adjoint-optimization, model predictive control) as an effective way to address the cited challenge. In general, RL represents a model-free strategy where an agent is trained to find the optimal policy - the action at every time step that will maximize cumulative long-term performance of a given process- only by continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., SAGD process). This environment is modeled as a Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) and a state must be defined to characterize it. During the interaction process, at each time step, the agent executes an action, receives a scalar reward (e.g., net present value) due to the action taken and observes the new state (e.g., pressure distribution of the reservoir) of the environment. This process continuous for a number of simulations or episodes until convergence is achieved. One approach to solve the RL problem is to parametrize the policy using well-known methods, e.g., linear functions, SVR, neural networks, etc. This approach is based on maximizing the performance of the process with respect to the parameters of the policy. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, after every episode a long-term performance of the process is obtained and the parameters of the policy are updated using gradient-ascent methods. In this work policy gradient is used to find the steam injection policy that maximizes cumulative net present value of a SAGD process. The environment is represented by a reservoir simulation model inspired by northern Alberta reservoir and the policy is parametrized using a deep neural network. Results show that optimal steam injection can be characterized in two regions: 1) an increase or slight increase of steam injection rates, and 2) a sharp decrease until reaching the minimum value. Furthermore, the first region's objective appears to be more of pressure maintenance using high steam injection rates. In the second region, the objective is to collect more reward or achieve high values of daily net present value due to the reduction of steam injection while keeping high oil production values.", "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/213104-ms", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4379523790", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.7454452514648438, "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Well SAGD Optimization: A Policy Gradient Approach"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2025.3546717", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4408048039", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7453441619873047, "title": "Transfer of Reinforcement Learning-Based Powertrain Controllers From Model- to Hardware-in-the-Loop"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 29, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.108735", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3157575065", "publication_year": 2021, "score": 0.7452807426452637, "title": "Optimization of steam injection in SAGD using reinforcement learning"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 37, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.03.012", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4394590207", "publication_year": 2024, "score": 0.7448863983154297, "title": "A novel collaborative agent reinforcement learning framework based on an attention mechanism and disjunctive graph embedding for flexible job shop scheduling problem"}, {"abstract": "Iterative learning control (ILC) is a high-performance control design method for systems working in repetitive manner and has seen many applications in practice.

Unsworth1, 2 1 University of Alberta, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Canada 2 National Research Council, National Institute for Nanotechnology, Canada 3 University of Alberta, Neurochemical Research Unit, Canada Neurotrophic factor peptide analogues are capable of promoting healing by neurogenesis, promoting neuronal survival and attenuating glial activation. In vivo peptide delivery is hard due to susceptibility to proteases, but they are considered ideal therapeutics due to specificity, potency, and size (ie. diffusion). Self-assembling peptide (RADA)4 is a novel class of peptide that, upon injection, assembles into a 3D nanoscaffold, capable of storing water and molecules. Synthesizing peptide therapeutics onto this nanoscaffold may afford protection from proteases, whilst utilizing local enzymes (ie. MMP-2) for localized, ‘on-demand’ release. Herein we study the self-assembly of engineered peptides into enzymatically sensitive nanoscaffolds for release kinetics, gial activity, and PC12 neurogenesis. Specifically, peptides with high ((RADA)4-GG-GPQG+IASQ (CP1)) and low ((RADA)4-GG-GPQG+PAGQ (CP2)) MMP-2 sensitivity were investigated ('+' = scissile bond)[1]. DGGL, a cilliary neurotrophic factor analogue, and MVG, a brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion stimulant, were tethered to CP1 and CP2, and mixed with (RADA)4-IKVAV as a means of promoting cell adherence[2]-[4]. Nanoscaffold self-assembly, enzyme-induced release of DGGL and MVG, glial activation and resulting PC12 neurogenesis were evaluated. Release kinetics shown to be related to the high (CP1) and low (CP2) activity cut sites and their concentrations. Peptide release could be controlled between 0 and 100%, over 32 days, depending on nanoscaffold design. Nanoscaffold seeded microglia were visually ramified and MTT levels were found to be highest in pure (RADA)4 nanoscaffolds; suggesting increased adherence and survival. MMP-2 released peptide-drugs promoted neurogenesis in PC12 cells; observed neurite extension and increased acetylcholine esterase signaling for nanoscaffolds composed of 10% v/v (RADA)4-IKVAV, 10% v/v (RADA)4-CP1/CP2-MVG/DGGL, and 80% (RADA)4. Finally, optimal seeding capacity was observed upon addition of 10% v/v (RADA)4-IKVAV to the nanoscaffolds. (RADA)4 nanoscaffolds were observed to self-assemble, exhibit microglia compatibility without affecting their response to LPS stimulation, and able to promote neurogenesis for PC12 cells upon release of MVG or DGGL . Thus a biomimetic, fully synthetic self-assembling nanoscaffold has been demonstrated for an injectable, tuneable drug release system with good microglia compatibility and neurogenesis response.

I. Interaction with Parallel Transverse Cold Plasma Waves Steinacker, Juergen ; Miller, James A. Abstract The gyroresonance of electrons with parallel transverse cold plasma waves is considered, and the Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the electron distribution function in the presence of a spectrum of turbulence is derived. A new resonance which produces a divergence in the Fokker-Planck coefficients is identified; it results when the electron is in gyroresonance with a wave that has a group velocity equal to the velocity of the electron along the magnetic field. Under the assumption of a power-law spectral density, the Fokker-Planck coefficients are calculated numerically, and their complicated momentum and pitch-angle dependence, as well as the influence of various approximations to the dispersion relation, gyroresonance condition, and spectral density are discussed. It is found that there is no resonance gap at any pitch angle as long as the full gyroresonance condition is used and waves propagating on both directions are present.

Alshememry2, 3 and Larry D. Unsworth1, 2, 4 1 University of Alberta, Biomedical Engineering, Canada 2 Nationa Research Council, National Institute for Nanotechnology, Canada 3 University of Alberta, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciencecs, Canada 4 University of Alberta, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Canada Introduction: As medicine continues to enter the realm of the nanoscale, there is an increasing demand for smart, flexible and safe biomaterials for sophisticated applications. Due to their temperature-induced reversible self-assembly, nanoparticles formed from elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) may be uniquely suited for drug delivery in conditions where temperature decreases are crucial, viz., hypothermic therapies[1]. ELPs are oligomers of the amino acid sequence VPGXG where X cannot be proline[2]. Most ELP work involves either peptides that can be manufactured using solid-phase synthesis (10 repeats or fewer) or large (160 repeats and above) proteins made using recombinant methods. The work herein describes the synthesis and characterization of medium length ELPs made up of 20-160 repeats and their behaviour as they self-assemble into nanoparticles. Materials and Methods: DNA sequences encoding ELP genes were assembled and the expression and purification followed standard protocols for polyhistidine-based affinity chromatography followed by inverse temperature cycling (ITC) to further purify the ELPs[3]. Solution properties were screened to produce particles, and it was found that in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4, ELPs formed particles at 0.4-2mg/mL depending on the specific construct. The particle assembly and disassembly were characterized using a Malvern Nano-ZS Zetasizer and a Hitachi S4800 high-resolution scanning electron microscope. DLS studies were performed duplicate by ramping the temperature by 5°C then equilibrating the sample for 2 minutes before measuring. Results: Conditions under which each ELP construct formed particles and disassociated varied (Figure 1). At temperatures increasing from 5 to 25°C, a leucine-containing ELP made of 20 repeats (L20) showed a particle diameter of approximately 5nm. This increased to about 600nm until the temperature reached 35°C at which point the particle size decreased to 450nm. Cooling this sample showed the same changes in size, but at lower temperatures than while heating. An L40 ELP exhibited only one increase in size at 15°C while heating and minimal dissolution behaviour upon cooling. A valine-containing ELP (V40) of similar length as L40 also showed only one increase in size with heating but at 25°C. This construct also showed dissolution behaviour at 20°C. Discussion: The choice of guest amino acid and/or number of repeats does play a role in the formation and dissolution properties of ELP nanoparticles. Decreasing chain lengths increase the temperature for assembly and dissolution, though perhaps not as drastically as hypothesized in the literature for this size range. More hydrophobic guest amino acid chemistries resulted in decreased transition temperatures by ~10°C as well as more noticeable hysteresis and particle stability upon cooling. The differences between the ELP constructs did not, however, result in any significant variance in size of the nanoparticles. Conclusion: The work herein describes the results of engineering ELPs to form nanoparticles by using constructs with atypical numbers of repeats. These ELPs do indeed form nanoparticles and variations in their sequences result in differences in their self-assembly and disassembly temperatures. This demonstrates that ELP-based nanoparticles are a robust, customizable biomaterial which can be engineered to behave in specific ways for a wide variety of biomaterial applications.

Abstract The Alfven and fast magnetosonic wave MHD modes can stochastically accelerate protons from super-Alfvenic to ultrarelativistic energies in solar flares. It is the Landau resonance, however, which generates most of the magnetosonic wave energy being dissipated on electron heating rather than on stochastic proton acceleration. Alfven waves are also subject to a nonlinear wave-particle interaction, and nonlinear Landau damping can selectively and efficiently heat the ambient protons to preaccelerate many to super-Alfvenic speeds. A spectrum of Alfven waves can therefore energize protons from low-temperature thermal to ultrarelativistic energies through a combination of linear and nonlinear particle-wave interactions.

Aaron Abstract We present a model for the acceleration of protons from thermal to relativistic energies on impulsive flare timescales. Long-wavelength Alfvén waves are assumed to be generated during the initial flare energy release by, for example, large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field. These waves nonlinearly cascade to high wavenumbers and eventually reach the dissipation range, whereupon they are damped by protons in the tail of the thermal distribution through gyroresonant interactions. The protons, in turn, are energized out the tail and, since longer wavelength waves are already present in the wave spectrum, are promptly accelerated to substantially higher energies. We find that for turbulence energy densities much smaller than the ambient magnetic field energy density and near the lower limit of that required by the total observed energy content of the protons, the acceleration of a sufficient number of protons to gamma-ray line-producing energies occurs on observed timescales essentially independent of the scale at which the waves are generated. Simple scaling arguments are presented in support of, and supported by, detailed numerical results.

A single ultrasound scan provides 3D spinal views directly. However, measuring ultrasonograph parameters is challenging, time-consuming, and requires considerable training. This study aimed to validate a machine learning method to measure the coronal curve angle on ultrasonographs automatically. Methods A total of 144 3D spinal ultrasonographs were extracted to train and validate a machine learning model. Among the 144 images, 70 were used for training, and 74 consisted of 144 curves for testing. Automatic coronal curve angle measurements were validated by comparing them with manual measurements performed by an experienced rater. The inter-method intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1 ), standard error of measurement (SEM), and percentage of measurements within clinical acceptance (≤ 5°) were analyzed. Results The automatic method detected 125/144 manually measured curves. The averages of the 125 manual and automatic coronal curve angle measurements were 22.4 ± 8.0° and 22.9 ± 8.7°, respectively. Good reliability was achieved with ICC 2,1 = 0.81 and SEM = 1.4°. A total of 75% (94/125) of the measurements were within clinical acceptance. The average measurement time per ultrasonograph was 36 ± 7 s. Additionally, the algorithm displayed the predicted centers of laminae to illustrate the measurement. Conclusion The automatic algorithm measured the coronal curve angle with moderate accuracy but good reliability. The algorithm’s quick measurement time and interpretability can make ultrasound a more accessible imaging method for children with AIS.

While in-person coaching can enhance care, it is only available to a minority of those with NDDs. Chatbots, or computer programs that simulate conversation, have emerged in the commercial sector as useful tools for answering questions, but their use in health care remains limited. To address this challenge, the researchers developed a chatbot named CAMI (Coaching Assistant for Medical/Health Information) that can provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services relevant to families of individuals with NDDs. The chatbot was developed, in collaboration with individuals with lived experience, to provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services that may be of interest. The developers used the Django framework (Django Software Foundation) for the development and used a knowledge graph to depict the key entities in NDDs and their relationships to allow the chatbot to suggest web resources that may be related to the user queries. To identify NDD domain–specific entities from user input, a combination of standard sources (the Unified Medical Language System) and other entities were used which were identified by health professionals as well as collaborators. Although most entities were identified in the text, some were not captured in the system and therefore went undetected.

For the AI model development, 304 paired images were used for training; 76 pairs were employed for testing. The validation was evaluated by comparing curvature parameters, including Cobb angles (CA), apical axial vertebral rotation (AVR), kyphotic angle (T1–T12 KA), and lordotic angle (L1–L5 LA), to manual measurements from a rater with 8 years of scoliosis experience. The mean absolute differences ± standard deviation (MAD ± SD), the percentage of measurements within the clinically acceptable errors, the standard error of measurement (SEM), and the inter-method intraclass correlation coefficient ICC [2,1] were calculated. The average reconstruction speed of the 76 test images was recorded. Results Among the 76 test images, 134 and 128 CA were exported automatically and measured manually, respectively. The MAD ± SD for CA, AVR at apex, KA, and LA were 3.3° ± 3.5°, 1.5° ± 1.5°, 3.3° ± 2.6° and 3.5° ± 2.5°, respectively, and 98% of these measurements were within the clinical acceptance errors.

To save time and improve measurement accuracy, a machine learning algorithm was developed to automatically extract the KA and LA.

Several organizations aim to build databases that can be searched based on the needs of target groups. One such group is individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and their families. NDDs affect up to 18% of the population and have major social and economic impacts. The current limitations in communicating information for individuals with NDDs include the absence of shared terminology and the lack of efficient labeling processes for web resources. Because of these limitations, health professionals, support groups, and families are unable to share, combine, and access resources. Objective We aimed to develop a natural language–based pipeline to label resources by leveraging standard and free-text vocabularies obtained through text analysis, and then represent those resources as a weighted knowledge graph. Methods Using a combination of experts and service/organization databases, we created a data set of web resources for NDDs. Text from these websites was scraped and collected into a corpus of textual data on NDDs. This corpus was used to construct a knowledge graph suitable for use by both experts and nonexperts. Named entity recognition, topic modeling, document classification, and location detection were used to extract knowledge from the corpus. Results We developed a resource annotation pipeline using diverse natural language processing algorithms to annotate web resources and stored them in a structured knowledge graph. The graph contained 78,181 annotations obtained from the combination of standard terminologies and a free-text vocabulary obtained using topic modeling. An application of the constructed knowledge graph is a resource search interface using the ordered weighted averaging operator to rank resources based on a user query.

Finding their embedded representations is thus highly desirable as it makes them easily operated on and reasoned with by machines. With this in mind, we propose a simple meta-strategy for embedding knowledge graphs using probabilistic coarsening. In this approach, a knowledge graph is first coarsened before being embedded by an arbitrary embedding method. The resulting coarse embeddings are then extended down as those of the initial knowledge graph. Although straightforward, this allows for faster training by reducing knowledge graph complexity while revealing its higher-order structures. We demonstrate this empirically on four real-world datasets, which show that coarse embeddings are learned faster and are often of higher quality.

The transformer-based language models have contributed to a renewed interest in commonsense knowledge due to the abilities of deep learning models. Recent literature has focused on analyzing commonsense embedded within the pre-trained parameters of these models and embedding missing commonsense using knowledge graphs and fine-tuning. We base our current work on the empirically proven language understanding of very large transformer-based language models to expand a limited commonsense knowledge graph, initially generated only on visual data. The few-shot-prompted pre-trained language models can learn the context of an initial knowledge graph with less bias than language models fine-tuned on a large initial corpus. It is also shown that these models can offer new concepts that are added to the vision-based knowledge graph. This two-step approach of vision mining and language model prompts results in the auto-generation of a commonsense knowledge graph well equipped with physical commonsense, which is human commonsense gained by interacting with the physical world. To prompt the language models, we adapted the chain-of-thought method of prompting. To the best of our knowledge, it is a novel contribution to the domain of the generation of commonsense knowledge, which can result in a five-fold cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art. Another contribution is assigning fuzzy linguistic terms to the generated triples. The process is end to end in the context of knowledge graphs.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) represent a group of diagnoses, affecting up to 18% of the global population, involving differences in the development of cognitive or social functions. In this study, we focus on 2 NDDs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which involve multiple symptoms and interventions requiring interactions between 2 important stakeholders: parents and health professionals. There is a gap in our understanding of differences between mental models for each stakeholder, making communication between stakeholders more difficult than it could be. Objective We aim to build knowledge graphs (KGs) from web-based information relevant to each stakeholder as proxies of mental models. These KGs will accelerate the identification of shared and divergent concerns between stakeholders. The developed KGs can help improve knowledge mobilization, communication, and care for individuals with ADHD and ASD. Methods We created 2 data sets by collecting the posts from web-based forums and PubMed abstracts related to ADHD and ASD. We utilized the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to detect biomedical concepts and applied Positive Pointwise Mutual Information followed by truncated Singular Value Decomposition to obtain corpus-based concept embeddings for each data set. Each data set is represented as a KG using a property graph model. Semantic relatedness between concepts is calculated to rank the relation strength of concepts and stored in the KG as relation weights. UMLS disorder-relevant semantic types are used to provide additional categorical information about each concept’s domain. Results The developed KGs contain concepts from both data sets, with node sizes representing the co-occurrence frequency of concepts and edge sizes representing relevance between concepts. ADHD- and ASD-related concepts from different semantic types shows diverse areas of concerns and complex needs of the conditions. KG identifies converging and diverging concepts between health professionals literature (PubMed) and parental concerns (web-based forums), which may correspond to the differences between mental models for each stakeholder. Conclusions We show for the first time that generating KGs from web-based data can capture the complex needs of families dealing with ADHD or ASD. Moreover, we showed points of convergence between families and health professionals’ KGs. Natural language processing–based KG provides access to a large sample size, which is often a limiting factor for traditional in-person mental model mapping. Our work offers a high throughput access to mental model maps, which could be used for further in-person validation, knowledge mobilization projects, and basis for communication about potential blind spots from stakeholders in interactions about NDDs.

A network where links between nodes may exist on different relations - called a multilayer network - is a flexible and increasingly common type of network since it allows for describing more complex interactions between nodes. Modeling such networks is thus an important task as it allows machines to reason with them intelligently and perform tasks such a link prediction, node classification, and community detection. Two common approaches to modeling multilayer networks are blockmodeling and embedding models. In this paper, we propose a model which fuses these approaches in a neural architecture, allowing it to leverage their respective strengths. To do this, we follow the standard blockmodeling approach of assigning nodes to communities and extending community interactions to node interactions. Community assignment is inspired by embedding models such that each node has an embedding which generates its community assignment. We account for network multilayeredness by mixing a relation embedding with the community interactions vector which acts as a relational modifier on community interactions. We evaluate our model on the three aforementioned tasks using real-world datasets and compare against state-of-the-art models. We find that performance by state-of-the-art models is highly dataset dependent and that our model achieves comparable results. We conclude that blockmodels may be successfully fused with embedding models for network modeling using a neural architecture and that simply mixing a relation embedding with community interactions is a viable way of handling for network multilayeredness.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3199990139", "publication_year": 2021, "title": "Neural Blockmodeling for Multilayer Networks"}, {"abstract": "Graph-based Knowledge Bases (KBs) are composed of relational facts that can be perceived as two entities, called head and tail, linked via a relation.

These should be performed automatically, especially in the case when the main sources of facts are textual documents. For this reason, a task of Relation Extraction (RE), i.e., predicting a relation that links two entities mentioned in a sentence, is one of the most important activities. Using RE processes, new relational facts can be extracted, and KBs can be built and updated using unstructured information. In this paper, we propose a novel procedure for RE.

Various types of robots have been applied to the so-called field of Edutainment, i.e., the field that combines education with entertainment. This paper introduces a novel fuzzy-based system for a human-robot cooperative Edutainment. This co-learning system includes a brain-computer interface (BCI) ontology model and a Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)-based Reinforcement Learning Agent (FRL-Agent). The proposed FRL-Agent is composed of (1) a human learning agent, (2) a robotic teaching agent, (3) a Bayesian estimation agent, (4) a robotic BCI agent, (5) a fuzzy machine learning agent, and (6) a fuzzy BCI ontology. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, the FRL-Agent is used as a robot teacher in a number of elementary schools, junior high schools, and at a university to allow robot teachers and students to learn together in the classroom. The participated students use handheld devices to indirectly or directly interact with the robot teachers to learn English. Additionally, a number of university students wear a commercial EEG device with eight electrode channels to learn English and listen to music. In the experiments, the robotic BCI agent analyzes the collected signals from the EEG device and transforms them into five physiological indices when the students are learning or listening. The Bayesian estimation agent and fuzzy machine learning agent optimize the parameters of the FRL agent and store them in the fuzzy BCI ontology. The experimental results show that the robot teachers motivate students to learn and stimulate their progress. The fuzzy machine learning agent is able to predict the five physiological indices based on the eight-channel EEG data and the trained model. In addition, we also train the model to predict the other students’ feelings based on the analyzed physiological indices and labeled feelings. The FRL agent is able to provide personalized learning content based on the developed human and robot cooperative edutainment approaches. To our knowledge, the FRL agent has not applied to the teaching fields such as elementary schools before and it opens up a promising new line of research in human and robot co-learning. In the future, we hope the FRL agent will solve such an existing problem in the classroom that the high-performing students feel the learning contents are too simple to motivate their learning or the low-performing students are unable to keep up with the learning progress to choose to give up learning.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3096829936", "publication_year": 2020, "title": "FML-Based Reinforcement Learning Agent with Fuzzy Ontology for Human-Robot Cooperative Edutainment"}, {"abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3028954154", "publication_year": 2020, "title": "A Simple Method for Inducing Class Taxonomies in Knowledge Graphs"}, {"abstract": "The fourth industrial revolution - Industry 4.0 - puts emphasis on the application of intelligent technologies in the area of monitoring and identification of electrical equipment.

A human‐like way of accomplishing that without being too detailed yet learning more about data content is to summarize and map the data into concepts familiar to a person performing analysis. Processes of summarization help identify the most essential facts that are embedded in the data. All this is of significant importance for analysis of large amounts of business data required to make good and sound financial decisions. There are two aspects enabling more comprehensive yet easier processing of data: a standardized representation format of financial data; and a human‐friendly way of defining concepts and using them for building personalized models representing processing data. The first of the aspects has been addressed by the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL)—a standardized format of defining, representing and exchanging corporate and financial information. The second aspect is related to providing individuals with the ability to gain understanding of data content via determining a degree of truth of statements summarizing data based on their own perception of concepts they are looking for. In this paper, we introduce a tablet application— Tablet‐based input of Fuzzy Sets ( TiFS )—and demonstrate its usefulness for entering personalized definitions of concepts and terms that enable a quick analysis of financial data. Such analysis means utilization of soft queries and operations of aggregation that extract and summarize the data and present it in a form familiar to analysts. The application allows for defining concepts and terms with ‘finger‐made’ drawings representing a person's perception of concepts. Further, these definitions are used to build summarization statements for exploring XBRL data. They are equipped with ‘drawn’ definitions of linguistic terms (e.g. LARGE , SMALL , FAST ) and linguistic quantifiers (e.g. ALL , MOSTLY ), and enable summarization of data content from the perspective of a user's interests. The ‘drawn’ linguistic terms and quantifiers represent membership functions of fuzzy sets. Utilization of fuzzy sets allows for performing operations of data summarization in a human‐like way.

The Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets have been proposed as a new class of non-standard fuzzy sets.

In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Pythagorean fuzzy relations for identifying a degree of matching between users based on their evaluations of items. We use triangular compositions to determine users that match positive evaluations, and users that agree on negative ones.

XBRL defines an easily interpretable, machine‐readable and XML‐based data format.

Such queries are able to provide the users with results similar to the results obtained when they analyse data themselves. Linguistic terms and qualifiers are represented as fuzzy sets.

On multiple occasions they expect precise, as much as possible, results.

Existing systems supporting the users in their search activities provide them with some variations, but it is not a controlled process. Diversity is accidental. The users do not have any influence on a degree or extensiveness of this diversity. In this presentation we state that application of fuzziness in systems supporting users in their search will allow them to guide and control mechanisms that identify alternatives, and influence recommendations. The fuzzy-based methodologies are capable of dealing with imprecise and vague statements, and can be applied to scenarios where the users want to relax their requirements. This means the users are able to browse and explore variety of things that do not match the search criteria to the highest possible degree. The two applications of fuzzy methods that ensure controllable selection processes and illustrate benefits of fuzzy-based processing of available information are illustrated. Firstly, we concentrate on social networks. A methodology for selecting groups of individuals that satisfy linguistically described requirements regarding the degree of matching between users' interests and collective interests of groups is presented. Secondly, we offer a novel recommending approach that provides users with a fuzzy-based process aiming at construction of lists of suggested items.

One of the most intriguing ideas of this new paradigm is related to the vision of web systems requiring minimal involvement of humans in activities related to a pre-selection and eventually selection of most promising alternatives among all obtained options. In order to perform such a task, systems have to be able to mimic users' behaviour. To be more specific, such systems should know not only users' preferences but also users' levels of acceptance of alternatives that satisfy multiple criteria to a different degree.

To address this deficiency, this paper introduces an extension of FML called FMLScript.

This research aims to provide an automated method for classification of articles into the structure of medical document repositories, which would support currently performed extensive manual work. The proposed method classifies articles from the largest medical repository, MEDLINE, using state of the art data mining technology. The method is based on a novel associative classification technique which considers recurrent items and most importantly multi-label characteristic of the MEDLINE data. Based on large scale experiments that utilize 350,000 documents several different classification algorithms have been compared including both recurrent and non-recurrent associative classification. The algorithms are capable of assigning each medical document to several classes (multi-label classification) and are characterized by relatively high accuracy. We also investigate different measures of classification quality and point out pros and cons of each.

The networks under discussion are homogeneous architectures comprising of OR/AND neurons originally introduced by Hirota and Pedrycz. Being treated here as generic processing units, OR/AND neurons are neurofuzzy constructs that exhibit well-defined logic characteristics and are endowed with a high level of parametric flexibility and come with significant interpretation abilities. The composite logic nature of the logic neurons becomes instrumental in covering a broad spectrum of logic dependencies whose character spread in-between between those being captured by plain and and or logic descriptors (connectives). From the functional standpoint, the developed network realizes a logic approximation of multidimensional mappings between unit hypercubes, that is transformations from [0, 1]n to [0, 1]m. The way in which the structure of the network has been formed is highly modular and becomes reflective of a general concept of decomposition of logic expressions and Boolean functions (as being commonly encountered in two-valued logic). In essence, given a collection of input variables, selected is their subset and transformed into new composite variable, which in turn is used in the consecutive module of the network. These intermediate synthetic variables are the result of the successive problem (mapping) decomposition. The development of the network is realized through genetic optimization. This helps address important issues of structural optimization (where we are concerned with a selection of a subset of variables and their allocation within the network) and reaching a global minimum when carrying out an extensive parametric optimization (adjustments of the connections of the neurons). The paper offers a comprehensive and user-interactive design procedure including a simple pruning mechanism whose intention is to enhance the interpretability of the network while reducing its size. The experimental studies comprise of three parts. First, we demonstrate the performance of the network on Boolean data (that leads to some useful comparative observations considering a wealth of optimization tools available in two-valued logic and digital systems). Second, we discuss synthetic multivalued data that helps focus on the approximation abilities of the network.

{"timestamp": "2025-12-17T18:10:18.164Z", "question": "a)", "answer": "You selected option “a)” (Marc Secanell). Summary and next steps below.\n\nShort answer about algorithms used by Marc Secanell\n- Marc Secanell — Mechanical Engineering — is linked in the provided Author Data only to a publication titled:\n  - Contents\n- The title \"Contents\" is non‑specific and no abstract/methods were provided in the semantic hits. From this metadata alone I cannot infer which algorithms Marc Secanell uses (no method keywords such as \"finite element\", \"reinforcement learning\", \"PPO\", \"FEM\", \"CFD\", \"gradient descent\", etc., appear).\n\nAuthors found in the provided Author Data (author — department) and their exact (full) publication title(s)\n- Marc Secanell — Mechanical Engineering  \n  - Contents\n- Arno de Klerk — Chemical and Materials Engineering  \n  - Contents\n- Gail Marilyn Thornton — Mechanical Engineering  \n  - Contents\n- William Pick — Chemical and Materials Engineering  \n  - Contents\n- Manisha Gupta — Electrical and Computer Engineering  \n  - Contents\n- John Nychka — Chemical and Materials Engineering  \n  - C-2004\n- Janet A. W. Elliott — Chemical and Materials Engineering  \n  - C-2004\n- Zhan Shu — Electrical and Computer Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- Yindi Jing — Electrical and Computer Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- Japan Trivedi — Civil and Environmental Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- Karen Dow — Civil and Environmental Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- Phillip Choi — Chemical and Materials Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- James Bracken — Faculty of Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- Huazhou Li — Civil and Environmental Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n- Lianne Lefsrud — Chemical and Materials Engineering  \n  - Introduction\n\nWhy I cannot specify algorithms from these entries\n- The publication titles in the provided metadata are generic (e.g., \"Contents\", \"Introduction\", \"C-2004\") and lack abstracts or method sections. Algorithm identification requires a full paper title, abstract, DOI/openalex_url with accessible metadata, or the PDF.\n\nSuggested next steps (pick one)\n1. I can fetch the metadata/abstract for Marc Secanell's listed item (the semantic_hits include a DOI/openalex_url) and check for algorithm/method details — tell me to retrieve the DOI/openalex_url for \"Contents\".  \n2. Provide a more specific paper title, DOI, or PDF for Marc Secanell (or another author) and I will extract the algorithms used.  \n3. If you meant a different researcher (for example Marek Reformat / Marc Reformatingf), tell me the correct name and I will search the provided data for their publications.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?", "intent": {"author": null, "department": null, "end_year": null, "intent": "OPEN_QUESTION", "scope": null, "second_author": null, "start_year": null, "topic": null}, "cypher": "UNWIND $titles AS title\nMATCH (p:Publication) WHERE p.title = title\nMATCH (p)<-[:PUBLISHED]-(ap:AuthorProfile)<-[:HAS_PROFILE]-(person:Person)\nWHERE person.userId IS NOT NULL OR person.ccid IS NOT NULL\nOPTIONAL MATCH (person)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(d:Department)\nRETURN p.title AS title, person.name AS author_name, collect(DISTINCT d.department) AS departments", "dbRows": [{"author_name": "Marc Secanell", "departments": ["Mechanical Engineering"], "title": "Contents"}, {"author_name": "Arno de Klerk", "departments": ["Chemical and Materials Engineering"], "title": "Contents"}, {"author_name": "Gail Marilyn Thornton", "departments": ["Mechanical Engineering"], "title": "Contents"}, {"author_name": "William Pick", "departments": ["Chemical and Materials Engineering"], "title": "Contents"}, {"author_name": "Manisha Gupta", "departments": ["Electrical and Computer Engineering"], "title": "Contents"}, {"author_name": "John Nychka", "departments": ["Chemical and Materials Engineering"], "title": "C-2004"}, {"author_name": "Janet A.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been presented as alternative to conventional methods (e.g., adjoint-optimization, model predictive control) as an effective way to address the cited challenge. In general, RL represents a model-free strategy where an agent is trained to find the optimal policy - the action at every time step that will maximize cumulative long-term performance of a given process- only by continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., SAGD process). This environment is modeled as a Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) and a state must be defined to characterize it. During the interaction process, at each time step, the agent executes an action, receives a scalar reward (e.g., net present value) due to the action taken and observes the new state (e.g., pressure distribution of the reservoir) of the environment. This process continuous for a number of simulations or episodes until convergence is achieved. One approach to solve the RL problem is to parametrize the policy using well-known methods, e.g., linear functions, SVR, neural networks, etc. This approach is based on maximizing the performance of the process with respect to the parameters of the policy. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, after every episode a long-term performance of the process is obtained and the parameters of the policy are updated using gradient-ascent methods. In this work policy gradient is used to find the steam injection policy that maximizes cumulative net present value of a SAGD process. The environment is represented by a reservoir simulation model inspired by northern Alberta reservoir and the policy is parametrized using a deep neural network. Results show that optimal steam injection can be characterized in two regions: 1) an increase or slight increase of steam injection rates, and 2) a sharp decrease until reaching the minimum value. Furthermore, the first region's objective appears to be more of pressure maintenance using high steam injection rates. In the second region, the objective is to collect more reward or achieve high values of daily net present value due to the reduction of steam injection while keeping high oil production values.", "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/213104-ms", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4379523790", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.7455477714538574, "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Well SAGD Optimization: A Policy Gradient Approach"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 29, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.108735", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3157575065", "publication_year": 2021, "score": 0.7453889846801758, "title": "Optimization of steam injection in SAGD using reinforcement learning"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2025.3546717", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4408048039", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7453827857971191, "title": "Transfer of Reinforcement Learning-Based Powertrain Controllers From Model- to Hardware-in-the-Loop"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 37, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.03.012", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4394590207", "publication_year": 2024, "score": 0.7448577880859375, "title": "A novel collaborative agent reinforcement learning framework based on an attention mechanism and disjunctive graph embedding for flexible job shop scheduling problem"}, {"abstract": "Iterative learning control (ILC) is a high-performance control design method for systems working in repetitive manner and has seen many applications in practice.

Churchward3, Kathryn G. Todd3 and Larry D. Unsworth1, 2 1 University of Alberta, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Canada 2 National Research Council, National Institute for Nanotechnology, Canada 3 University of Alberta, Neurochemical Research Unit, Canada Neurotrophic factor peptide analogues are capable of promoting healing by neurogenesis, promoting neuronal survival and attenuating glial activation. In vivo peptide delivery is hard due to susceptibility to proteases, but they are considered ideal therapeutics due to specificity, potency, and size (ie. diffusion). Self-assembling peptide (RADA)4 is a novel class of peptide that, upon injection, assembles into a 3D nanoscaffold, capable of storing water and molecules. Synthesizing peptide therapeutics onto this nanoscaffold may afford protection from proteases, whilst utilizing local enzymes (ie. MMP-2) for localized, ‘on-demand’ release. Herein we study the self-assembly of engineered peptides into enzymatically sensitive nanoscaffolds for release kinetics, gial activity, and PC12 neurogenesis. Specifically, peptides with high ((RADA)4-GG-GPQG+IASQ (CP1)) and low ((RADA)4-GG-GPQG+PAGQ (CP2)) MMP-2 sensitivity were investigated ('+' = scissile bond)[1]. DGGL, a cilliary neurotrophic factor analogue, and MVG, a brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion stimulant, were tethered to CP1 and CP2, and mixed with (RADA)4-IKVAV as a means of promoting cell adherence[2]-[4]. Nanoscaffold self-assembly, enzyme-induced release of DGGL and MVG, glial activation and resulting PC12 neurogenesis were evaluated. Release kinetics shown to be related to the high (CP1) and low (CP2) activity cut sites and their concentrations. Peptide release could be controlled between 0 and 100%, over 32 days, depending on nanoscaffold design. Nanoscaffold seeded microglia were visually ramified and MTT levels were found to be highest in pure (RADA)4 nanoscaffolds; suggesting increased adherence and survival. MMP-2 released peptide-drugs promoted neurogenesis in PC12 cells; observed neurite extension and increased acetylcholine esterase signaling for nanoscaffolds composed of 10% v/v (RADA)4-IKVAV, 10% v/v (RADA)4-CP1/CP2-MVG/DGGL, and 80% (RADA)4. Finally, optimal seeding capacity was observed upon addition of 10% v/v (RADA)4-IKVAV to the nanoscaffolds. (RADA)4 nanoscaffolds were observed to self-assemble, exhibit microglia compatibility without affecting their response to LPS stimulation, and able to promote neurogenesis for PC12 cells upon release of MVG or DGGL . Thus a biomimetic, fully synthetic self-assembling nanoscaffold has been demonstrated for an injectable, tuneable drug release system with good microglia compatibility and neurogenesis response.

Alshememry2, 3 and Larry D. Unsworth1, 2, 4 1 University of Alberta, Biomedical Engineering, Canada 2 Nationa Research Council, National Institute for Nanotechnology, Canada 3 University of Alberta, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciencecs, Canada 4 University of Alberta, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Canada Introduction: As medicine continues to enter the realm of the nanoscale, there is an increasing demand for smart, flexible and safe biomaterials for sophisticated applications. Due to their temperature-induced reversible self-assembly, nanoparticles formed from elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) may be uniquely suited for drug delivery in conditions where temperature decreases are crucial, viz., hypothermic therapies[1]. ELPs are oligomers of the amino acid sequence VPGXG where X cannot be proline[2]. Most ELP work involves either peptides that can be manufactured using solid-phase synthesis (10 repeats or fewer) or large (160 repeats and above) proteins made using recombinant methods. The work herein describes the synthesis and characterization of medium length ELPs made up of 20-160 repeats and their behaviour as they self-assemble into nanoparticles. Materials and Methods: DNA sequences encoding ELP genes were assembled and the expression and purification followed standard protocols for polyhistidine-based affinity chromatography followed by inverse temperature cycling (ITC) to further purify the ELPs[3]. Solution properties were screened to produce particles, and it was found that in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4, ELPs formed particles at 0.4-2mg/mL depending on the specific construct. The particle assembly and disassembly were characterized using a Malvern Nano-ZS Zetasizer and a Hitachi S4800 high-resolution scanning electron microscope. DLS studies were performed duplicate by ramping the temperature by 5°C then equilibrating the sample for 2 minutes before measuring. Results: Conditions under which each ELP construct formed particles and disassociated varied (Figure 1). At temperatures increasing from 5 to 25°C, a leucine-containing ELP made of 20 repeats (L20) showed a particle diameter of approximately 5nm. This increased to about 600nm until the temperature reached 35°C at which point the particle size decreased to 450nm. Cooling this sample showed the same changes in size, but at lower temperatures than while heating. An L40 ELP exhibited only one increase in size at 15°C while heating and minimal dissolution behaviour upon cooling. A valine-containing ELP (V40) of similar length as L40 also showed only one increase in size with heating but at 25°C. This construct also showed dissolution behaviour at 20°C. Discussion: The choice of guest amino acid and/or number of repeats does play a role in the formation and dissolution properties of ELP nanoparticles. Decreasing chain lengths increase the temperature for assembly and dissolution, though perhaps not as drastically as hypothesized in the literature for this size range. More hydrophobic guest amino acid chemistries resulted in decreased transition temperatures by ~10°C as well as more noticeable hysteresis and particle stability upon cooling. The differences between the ELP constructs did not, however, result in any significant variance in size of the nanoparticles. Conclusion: The work herein describes the results of engineering ELPs to form nanoparticles by using constructs with atypical numbers of repeats. These ELPs do indeed form nanoparticles and variations in their sequences result in differences in their self-assembly and disassembly temperatures. This demonstrates that ELP-based nanoparticles are a robust, customizable biomaterial which can be engineered to behave in specific ways for a wide variety of biomaterial applications.

A new skull exhibits previously unobserved variability and asymmetry in this species. As in the type, the right lateral parietal bar bears seven epiossifications, but the left parietal bar has eight. Epiossifications p3‒p6 are asymmetrical with respect to size, orientation, and position relative to the midline. A re-evaluation of variation in Styracosaurus that includes this skull expands the morphological range of the taxon to incorporate Rubeosaurus ovatus, requiring the synonymy of the latter with the former. Unlike the type, both p1 and p2 epiossifications are large. Epiossification p1 is procurved, and p2 is medially curved. These features converge on the morphology considered diagnostic for Centrosaurus. This observation, in combination with their sequential stratigraphic relationship and geographic overlap might suggest that Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus form an anagenic series, but the stratigraphic placement of skulls exhibiting putative ‘transitional’ morphologies does not support this hypothesis.

Because of its complexity, many simulators do not even attempt to incorporate three or more hydrocarbon phases, even though such cases are important in many low-temperature gasfloods or for high temperatures where hydrocarbons can partition into water. Multiphase flash algorithms typically use successive substitution (SS) followed by Newton's method. For NP-phase flash calculations, (NP–1) Rachford-Rice (RR) equations are solved in every iteration step in SS and, depending on the choice of independent variables, in Newton's method. Solution of RR equations determines both compositions and amounts of phases for a fixed overall composition and set of K-values. A robust algorithm for RR is critical to obtain convergence in multiphase compositional simulation and has not been satisfactorily developed, unlike the traditional two-phase flash. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for RR equations for multiphase compositional simulation that is guaranteed to converge to the correct solution independent of the number of phases for both positive and negative flash calculations. We derive a function whose gradient vector consists of RR equations. This correct solution to the RR equations is formulated as a minimization of the nonmonotonic convex function using the independent variables of (NP–1) phase mole fractions. The key to obtaining a robust algorithm is that we specify nonnegative constraints for the resulting equilibrium phase compositions, which are described by a very small region with no poles. The minimization uses Newton's direction with a line-search technique to exhibit superlinear convergence. We show a case in which a previously developed method cannot converge while our algorithm rapidly converges in a few iterations. We implement the algorithm both in a standalone flash code and in UTCOMP (Chang et al. 1990), a multiphase compositional simulator, and show that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge when a multiphase region exists as indicated by stability analysis.", "cited_by_count": 91, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/117752-pa", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2006745743", "publication_year": 2010, "score": 0.6830792427062988, "title": "A New Algorithm for Rachford-Rice for Multiphase Compositional Simulation"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 51, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2016.01.011", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2278233558", "publication_year": 2016, "score": 0.6804327964782715, "title": "An improved algorithm for finding all minimal paths in a network"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 44, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-147", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2167516501", "publication_year": 2014, "score": 0.6791925430297852, "title": "A fast and robust iterative algorithm for prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structures"}, {"abstract": "New algorithms for the design of trellis encoding data compression systems are described.

The algorithms' effectiveness for random sources is demonstrated through performance comparisons with other source coding systems and with theoretical bounds.

Second, an improved heuristic rule is proposed choose an appropriate d-MP to decompose each set of unspecified states.

A single ultrasound scan provides 3D spinal views directly. However, measuring ultrasonograph parameters is challenging, time-consuming, and requires considerable training. This study aimed to validate a machine learning method to measure the coronal curve angle on ultrasonographs automatically. Methods A total of 144 3D spinal ultrasonographs were extracted to train and validate a machine learning model. Among the 144 images, 70 were used for training, and 74 consisted of 144 curves for testing. Automatic coronal curve angle measurements were validated by comparing them with manual measurements performed by an experienced rater. The inter-method intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1 ), standard error of measurement (SEM), and percentage of measurements within clinical acceptance (≤ 5°) were analyzed. Results The automatic method detected 125/144 manually measured curves. The averages of the 125 manual and automatic coronal curve angle measurements were 22.4 ± 8.0° and 22.9 ± 8.7°, respectively. Good reliability was achieved with ICC 2,1 = 0.81 and SEM = 1.4°. A total of 75% (94/125) of the measurements were within clinical acceptance. The average measurement time per ultrasonograph was 36 ± 7 s. Additionally, the algorithm displayed the predicted centers of laminae to illustrate the measurement. Conclusion The automatic algorithm measured the coronal curve angle with moderate accuracy but good reliability. The algorithm’s quick measurement time and interpretability can make ultrasound a more accessible imaging method for children with AIS.

NDDs encompass various conditions affecting up to 14% of children in high-income countries, and most individuals present with complex phenotypes and related conditions. It is challenging for their families to develop literacy solely by searching information on the internet. While in-person coaching can enhance care, it is only available to a minority of those with NDDs. Chatbots, or computer programs that simulate conversation, have emerged in the commercial sector as useful tools for answering questions, but their use in health care remains limited. To address this challenge, the researchers developed a chatbot named CAMI (Coaching Assistant for Medical/Health Information) that can provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services relevant to families of individuals with NDDs. The chatbot was developed, in collaboration with individuals with lived experience, to provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services that may be of interest. The developers used the Django framework (Django Software Foundation) for the development and used a knowledge graph to depict the key entities in NDDs and their relationships to allow the chatbot to suggest web resources that may be related to the user queries. To identify NDD domain–specific entities from user input, a combination of standard sources (the Unified Medical Language System) and other entities were used which were identified by health professionals as well as collaborators. Although most entities were identified in the text, some were not captured in the system and therefore went undetected. Nonetheless, the chatbot was able to provide resources addressing most user queries related to NDDs. The researchers found that enriching the vocabulary with synonyms and lay language terms for specific subdomains enhanced entity detection. By using a data set of numerous individuals with NDDs, the researchers developed a knowledge graph that established meaningful connections between entities, allowing the chatbot to present related symptoms, diagnoses, and resources. To the researchers’ knowledge, CAMI is the first chatbot to provide resources related to NDDs. Our work highlighted the importance of engaging end users to supplement standard generic ontologies to named entities for language recognition. It also demonstrates that complex medical and health-related information can be integrated using knowledge graphs and leveraging existing large datasets. This has multiple implications: generalizability to other health domains as well as reducing the need for experts and optimizing their input while keeping health care professionals in the loop. The researchers' work also shows how health and computer science domains need to collaborate to achieve the granularity needed to make chatbots truly useful and impactful.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4394968084", "publication_year": 2024, "title": "Developing a Chatbot to Support Individuals With Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Tutorial"}, {"abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4402771893", "publication_year": 2024, "title": "Integrating quantum CI and generative AI for Taiwanese/English co-learning"}, {"abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4402683050", "publication_year": 2024, "title": "Fine-tuning Language Models for Triple Extraction with Data Augmentation"}, {"abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4401338347", "publication_year": 2024, "title": "Transformer-Based Semantic SBERT Robot with CI Mechanism for Students and Machine Co-Learning"}, {"abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4401633487", "publication_year": 2024, "title": "Validity of machine learning algorithms for automatically extract growing rod length on radiographs in children with early-onset scoliosis"}, {"abstract": "Abstract Purpose To validate a fast 3D biplanar spinal radiograph reconstruction method with automatic extract curvature parameters using artificial intelligence (AI).

Several organizations aim to build databases that can be searched based on the needs of target groups. One such group is individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and their families. NDDs affect up to 18% of the population and have major social and economic impacts. The current limitations in communicating information for individuals with NDDs include the absence of shared terminology and the lack of efficient labeling processes for web resources. Because of these limitations, health professionals, support groups, and families are unable to share, combine, and access resources. Objective We aimed to develop a natural language–based pipeline to label resources by leveraging standard and free-text vocabularies obtained through text analysis, and then represent those resources as a weighted knowledge graph. Methods Using a combination of experts and service/organization databases, we created a data set of web resources for NDDs. Text from these websites was scraped and collected into a corpus of textual data on NDDs. This corpus was used to construct a knowledge graph suitable for use by both experts and nonexperts. Named entity recognition, topic modeling, document classification, and location detection were used to extract knowledge from the corpus. Results We developed a resource annotation pipeline using diverse natural language processing algorithms to annotate web resources and stored them in a structured knowledge graph. The graph contained 78,181 annotations obtained from the combination of standard terminologies and a free-text vocabulary obtained using topic modeling. An application of the constructed knowledge graph is a resource search interface using the ordered weighted averaging operator to rank resources based on a user query.

Finding their embedded representations is thus highly desirable as it makes them easily operated on and reasoned with by machines. With this in mind, we propose a simple meta-strategy for embedding knowledge graphs using probabilistic coarsening. In this approach, a knowledge graph is first coarsened before being embedded by an arbitrary embedding method. The resulting coarse embeddings are then extended down as those of the initial knowledge graph. Although straightforward, this allows for faster training by reducing knowledge graph complexity while revealing its higher-order structures. We demonstrate this empirically on four real-world datasets, which show that coarse embeddings are learned faster and are often of higher quality.

NDDs encompass various conditions affecting up to 14% of children in high-income countries, and most individuals present with complex phenotypes and related conditions. It is challenging for their families to develop literacy solely by searching information on the internet. While in-person coaching can enhance care, it is only available to a minority of those with NDDs. Chatbots, or computer programs that simulate conversation, have emerged in the commercial sector as useful tools for answering questions, but their use in health care remains limited. To address this challenge, the researchers developed a chatbot named CAMI (Coaching Assistant for Medical/Health Information) that can provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services relevant to families of individuals with NDDs. The chatbot was developed, in collaboration with individuals with lived experience, to provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services that may be of interest. The developers used the Django framework (Django Software Foundation) for the development and used a knowledge graph to depict the key entities in NDDs and their relationships to allow the chatbot to suggest web resources that may be related to the user queries. To identify NDD domain–specific entities from user input, a combination of standard sources (the Unified Medical Language System) and other entities were used which were identified by health professionals as well as collaborators. Although most entities were identified in the text, some were not captured in the system and therefore went undetected. Nonetheless, the chatbot was able to provide resources addressing most user queries related to NDDs. The researchers found that enriching the vocabulary with synonyms and lay language terms for specific subdomains enhanced entity detection. By using a data set of numerous individuals with NDDs, the researchers developed a knowledge graph that established meaningful connections between entities, allowing the chatbot to present related symptoms, diagnoses, and resources. To the researchers’ knowledge, CAMI is the first chatbot to provide resources related to NDDs. Our work highlighted the importance of engaging end users to supplement standard generic ontologies to named entities for language recognition. It also demonstrates that complex medical and health-related information can be integrated using knowledge graphs and leveraging existing large datasets. This has multiple implications: generalizability to other health domains as well as reducing the need for experts and optimizing their input while keeping health care professionals in the loop. The researchers' work also shows how health and computer science domains need to collaborate to achieve the granularity needed to make chatbots truly useful and impactful. </sec>", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4381846429", "publication_year": 2023, "title": "Developing a Chatbot to Support Individuals With Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Tutorial (Preprint)"}, {"abstract": "The increased demand for Smart Home control technologies and the rapid growth of AI-based approaches provide an opportunity to develop systems that significantly reduce homeowners' electricity costs and decrease the inconvenience of power outages.

We base our current work on the empirically proven language understanding of very large transformer-based language models to expand a limited commonsense knowledge graph, initially generated only on visual data.

This two-step approach of vision mining and language model prompts results in the auto-generation of a commonsense knowledge graph well equipped with physical commonsense, which is human commonsense gained by interacting with the physical world. To prompt the language models, we adapted the chain-of-thought method of prompting.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) represent a group of diagnoses, affecting up to 18% of the global population, involving differences in the development of cognitive or social functions. In this study, we focus on 2 NDDs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which involve multiple symptoms and interventions requiring interactions between 2 important stakeholders: parents and health professionals. There is a gap in our understanding of differences between mental models for each stakeholder, making communication between stakeholders more difficult than it could be. Objective We aim to build knowledge graphs (KGs) from web-based information relevant to each stakeholder as proxies of mental models. These KGs will accelerate the identification of shared and divergent concerns between stakeholders. The developed KGs can help improve knowledge mobilization, communication, and care for individuals with ADHD and ASD. Methods We created 2 data sets by collecting the posts from web-based forums and PubMed abstracts related to ADHD and ASD. We utilized the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to detect biomedical concepts and applied Positive Pointwise Mutual Information followed by truncated Singular Value Decomposition to obtain corpus-based concept embeddings for each data set. Each data set is represented as a KG using a property graph model. Semantic relatedness between concepts is calculated to rank the relation strength of concepts and stored in the KG as relation weights. UMLS disorder-relevant semantic types are used to provide additional categorical information about each concept’s domain. Results The developed KGs contain concepts from both data sets, with node sizes representing the co-occurrence frequency of concepts and edge sizes representing relevance between concepts. ADHD- and ASD-related concepts from different semantic types shows diverse areas of concerns and complex needs of the conditions. KG identifies converging and diverging concepts between health professionals literature (PubMed) and parental concerns (web-based forums), which may correspond to the differences between mental models for each stakeholder. Conclusions We show for the first time that generating KGs from web-based data can capture the complex needs of families dealing with ADHD or ASD. Moreover, we showed points of convergence between families and health professionals’ KGs. Natural language processing–based KG provides access to a large sample size, which is often a limiting factor for traditional in-person mental model mapping. Our work offers a high throughput access to mental model maps, which could be used for further in-person validation, knowledge mobilization projects, and basis for communication about potential blind spots from stakeholders in interactions about NDDs.

A network where links between nodes may exist on different relations - called a multilayer network - is a flexible and increasingly common type of network since it allows for describing more complex interactions between nodes. Modeling such networks is thus an important task as it allows machines to reason with them intelligently and perform tasks such a link prediction, node classification, and community detection. Two common approaches to modeling multilayer networks are blockmodeling and embedding models. In this paper, we propose a model which fuses these approaches in a neural architecture, allowing it to leverage their respective strengths. To do this, we follow the standard blockmodeling approach of assigning nodes to communities and extending community interactions to node interactions. Community assignment is inspired by embedding models such that each node has an embedding which generates its community assignment. We account for network multilayeredness by mixing a relation embedding with the community interactions vector which acts as a relational modifier on community interactions. We evaluate our model on the three aforementioned tasks using real-world datasets and compare against state-of-the-art models. We find that performance by state-of-the-art models is highly dataset dependent and that our model achieves comparable results.

This co-learning system includes a brain-computer interface (BCI) ontology model and a Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)-based Reinforcement Learning Agent (FRL-Agent). The proposed FRL-Agent is composed of (1) a human learning agent, (2) a robotic teaching agent, (3) a Bayesian estimation agent, (4) a robotic BCI agent, (5) a fuzzy machine learning agent, and (6) a fuzzy BCI ontology. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, the FRL-Agent is used as a robot teacher in a number of elementary schools, junior high schools, and at a university to allow robot teachers and students to learn together in the classroom. The participated students use handheld devices to indirectly or directly interact with the robot teachers to learn English. Additionally, a number of university students wear a commercial EEG device with eight electrode channels to learn English and listen to music. In the experiments, the robotic BCI agent analyzes the collected signals from the EEG device and transforms them into five physiological indices when the students are learning or listening. The Bayesian estimation agent and fuzzy machine learning agent optimize the parameters of the FRL agent and store them in the fuzzy BCI ontology. The experimental results show that the robot teachers motivate students to learn and stimulate their progress. The fuzzy machine learning agent is able to predict the five physiological indices based on the eight-channel EEG data and the trained model. In addition, we also train the model to predict the other students’ feelings based on the analyzed physiological indices and labeled feelings. The FRL agent is able to provide personalized learning content based on the developed human and robot cooperative edutainment approaches. To our knowledge, the FRL agent has not applied to the teaching fields such as elementary schools before and it opens up a promising new line of research in human and robot co-learning.

The second aspect is related to providing individuals with the ability to gain understanding of data content via determining a degree of truth of statements summarizing data based on their own perception of concepts they are looking for. In this paper, we introduce a tablet application— Tablet‐based input of Fuzzy Sets ( TiFS )—and demonstrate its usefulness for entering personalized definitions of concepts and terms that enable a quick analysis of financial data. Such analysis means utilization of soft queries and operations of aggregation that extract and summarize the data and present it in a form familiar to analysts. The application allows for defining concepts and terms with ‘finger‐made’ drawings representing a person's perception of concepts. Further, these definitions are used to build summarization statements for exploring XBRL data. They are equipped with ‘drawn’ definitions of linguistic terms (e.g. LARGE , SMALL , FAST ) and linguistic quantifiers (e.g. ALL , MOSTLY ), and enable summarization of data content from the perspective of a user's interests. The ‘drawn’ linguistic terms and quantifiers represent membership functions of fuzzy sets. Utilization of fuzzy sets allows for performing operations of data summarization in a human‐like way. The application of TiFS illustrates ease of inputting personalized definitions of concepts and their influence on the interpretation of data. This introduces aspects of personalization and adaptation of artificial intelligence systems to perceptions and views of individuals. The proposed application is used to perform a basic analysis of an XBRL document.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2799730457", "publication_year": 2018, "title": "Defining personalized concepts for XBRL using iPAD‐drawn fuzzy sets"}, {"abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2901314581", "publication_year": 2018, "title": "Drawing on the iPad to input fuzzy sets with an application to linguistic data science"}, {"abstract": "Abstract This work proposes a software environment implementing a methodology for acquiring and exploiting the collective perception (CP) of Points of Interests (POIs) in a Smart City, which is meant to support decision makers in urban planning and management.

The Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets have been proposed as a new class of non-standard fuzzy sets.

In this presentation we state that application of fuzziness in systems supporting users in their search will allow them to guide and control mechanisms that identify alternatives, and influence recommendations. The fuzzy-based methodologies are capable of dealing with imprecise and vague statements, and can be applied to scenarios where the users want to relax their requirements. This means the users are able to browse and explore variety of things that do not match the search criteria to the highest possible degree. The two applications of fuzzy methods that ensure controllable selection processes and illustrate benefits of fuzzy-based processing of available information are illustrated.

In order to perform such a task, systems have to be able to mimic users' behaviour.

From that moment on, many researches have been using FML and other XML-based languages for modeling and developing fuzzy systems.

To address this deficiency, this paper introduces an extension of FML called FMLScript.

This paper looks at the issue of rule-based description of attributes of software with different levels of maintainability. Varieties of rules are extracted from a data set that represents human evaluation of maintainability of software objects. Rule similarity and rule inclusion measures are used to identify the most diverse sets of rules representing human evaluation criteria. Additionally, the rules representing all evaluators are analyzed using a rule similarity concept in order to learn more about common evaluation criteria", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2004681822", "publication_year": 2006, "title": "Software Maintenance: Similarity and Inclusion of Rules in Knowledge Extraction"}, {"abstract": "Computing with words introduced by Zadeh becomes a significant concept in processing of knowledge.

Based on large scale experiments that utilize 350,000 documents several different classification algorithms have been compared including both recurrent and non-recurrent associative classification. The algorithms are capable of assigning each medical document to several classes (multi-label classification) and are characterized by relatively high accuracy.

The networks under discussion are homogeneous architectures comprising of OR/AND neurons originally introduced by Hirota and Pedrycz. Being treated here as generic processing units, OR/AND neurons are neurofuzzy constructs that exhibit well-defined logic characteristics and are endowed with a high level of parametric flexibility and come with significant interpretation abilities. The composite logic nature of the logic neurons becomes instrumental in covering a broad spectrum of logic dependencies whose character spread in-between between those being captured by plain and and or logic descriptors (connectives). From the functional standpoint, the developed network realizes a logic approximation of multidimensional mappings between unit hypercubes, that is transformations from [0, 1]n to [0, 1]m. The way in which the structure of the network has been formed is highly modular and becomes reflective of a general concept of decomposition of logic expressions and Boolean functions (as being commonly encountered in two-valued logic). In essence, given a collection of input variables, selected is their subset and transformed into new composite variable, which in turn is used in the consecutive module of the network. These intermediate synthetic variables are the result of the successive problem (mapping) decomposition. The development of the network is realized through genetic optimization. This helps address important issues of structural optimization (where we are concerned with a selection of a subset of variables and their allocation within the network) and reaching a global minimum when carrying out an extensive parametric optimization (adjustments of the connections of the neurons). The paper offers a comprehensive and user-interactive design procedure including a simple pruning mechanism whose intention is to enhance the interpretability of the network while reducing its size. The experimental studies comprise of three parts. First, we demonstrate the performance of the network on Boolean data (that leads to some useful comparative observations considering a wealth of optimization tools available in two-valued logic and digital systems).

The traditional approach of using joint rewards for team performance is questioned due to a lack of theoretical backing. The authors explore the impact of changing the reward function from joint to individual on learning centralized decentralized execution algorithms in a Level-Based Foraging environment.

In general, RL represents a model-free strategy where an agent is trained to find the optimal policy - the action at every time step that will maximize cumulative long-term performance of a given process- only by continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., SAGD process). This environment is modeled as a Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) and a state must be defined to characterize it.

On the other hand, finding the optimal steam injection strategy (policy) represents a major challenge due to the complex dynamic of the physical phenomenon, i.e., nonlinear, slow, high order, time-varying, and potentially highly heterogeneous reservoirs. To address this challenge, the problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem that has typically been solved using adjoint state optimization and a model-predictive control (MPC) strategy. In contrast, this work presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach in which the mathematical model of the dynamic process (SAGD) is assumed unknown. An agent is trained to find the optimal policy only through continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., numerical reservoir simulation model). At each time step, the agent executes an action (e.g., increase steam injection rate), receives a reward (e.g., net present value) and observes the new state (e.g., pressure distribution) of the environment. During this interaction, an action-value function is approximated; this function will offer for a given state of the environment the action that will maximize total future reward. This process continues for multiple simulations (episodes) of the dynamic process until convergence is achieved. In this implementation, the state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) online policy learning algorithm is employed in which the action-value function is continually estimated after every time step and further used to choose the optimal action. The environment consists of a reservoir simulation model built using data from a reservoir located in northern Alberta. The model consists of one well pair (one injector and one producer) and production horizon of 250 days (one episode) is considered. The state of the environment is defined as cumulative, oil and water production, and water injection and for each time step; three possible actions are considered, i.e., increase, decrease or no change of current steam injection rate; and the reward represents the net present value (NPV). Additionally, stochastic gradient descent is used to approximate the action-value function. Results show that the optimal steam injection policy obtained using RL implementation improves NPV by at least 30% with more than 60% lower computation cost.", "cited_by_count": 28, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/193769-ms", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2904365926", "publication_year": 2018, "score": 0.715723991394043, "title": "Optimization of Steam Injection for Heavy Oil Reservoirs Using Reinforcement Learning"}, {"abstract": "This paper introduces intelligent central pattern generators (iCPGs) that can plan personalized walking trajectories for lower-limb exoskeletons. This can make walking more comfortable for the users by resolving one of the significant shortcomings of most commercially available exoskeletons, which is the use of pre-defined fixed trajectories for all users. The proposed method combines reinforcement learning (RL) with previously introduced adaptable central pattern generators (ACPGs) to learn a user's physical interaction behaviour and refine the exoskeleton's walking trajectories. The ACPG method embeds physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) in CPGs to make changing gait trajectories in real-time, possible. However, to effectively refine gait trajectories based on pHRIs, the parameters must be precisely identified and updated as a user interacts with the exoskeleton. Our proposed method uses RL to modify (amplify/attenuate) the pHRI energy based on a user's interaction behaviour, and form an effective energy value which can facilitate reaching desired gait pattern for users via iCPG dynamics. The proposed method can resolve the aforementioned challenges with ACPGs and personalized trajectory generation.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has great potential for autonomously training agents to perform complex control tasks with minimal human intervention. Due to costly data generation and safety constraints, however, its application is mostly limited to purely simulated domains. To use RL effectively in embedded system function development, the generated agents must be able to handle real-world applications. In this context, this work focuses on accelerating the training process of RL agents by combining Transfer Learning (TL) and X-in-the-Loop (XiL) simulation. For the use case of transient exhaust gas re-circulation control for an internal combustion engine, use of a computationally cheap Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation is made to select a suitable algorithm, fine-tune hyperparameters, and finally train candidate agents for the transfer.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been presented as alternative to conventional methods (e.g., adjoint-optimization, model predictive control) as an effective way to address the cited challenge. In general, RL represents a model-free strategy where an agent is trained to find the optimal policy - the action at every time step that will maximize cumulative long-term performance of a given process- only by continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., SAGD process). This environment is modeled as a Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) and a state must be defined to characterize it. During the interaction process, at each time step, the agent executes an action, receives a scalar reward (e.g., net present value) due to the action taken and observes the new state (e.g., pressure distribution of the reservoir) of the environment. This process continuous for a number of simulations or episodes until convergence is achieved. One approach to solve the RL problem is to parametrize the policy using well-known methods, e.g., linear functions, SVR, neural networks, etc. This approach is based on maximizing the performance of the process with respect to the parameters of the policy. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, after every episode a long-term performance of the process is obtained and the parameters of the policy are updated using gradient-ascent methods. In this work policy gradient is used to find the steam injection policy that maximizes cumulative net present value of a SAGD process. The environment is represented by a reservoir simulation model inspired by northern Alberta reservoir and the policy is parametrized using a deep neural network. Results show that optimal steam injection can be characterized in two regions: 1) an increase or slight increase of steam injection rates, and 2) a sharp decrease until reaching the minimum value. Furthermore, the first region's objective appears to be more of pressure maintenance using high steam injection rates. In the second region, the objective is to collect more reward or achieve high values of daily net present value due to the reduction of steam injection while keeping high oil production values.", "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/213104-ms", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4379523790", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.7454452514648438, "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Well SAGD Optimization: A Policy Gradient Approach"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2025.3546717", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4408048039", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7453441619873047, "title": "Transfer of Reinforcement Learning-Based Powertrain Controllers From Model- to Hardware-in-the-Loop"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 29, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.108735", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3157575065", "publication_year": 2021, "score": 0.7452807426452637, "title": "Optimization of steam injection in SAGD using reinforcement learning"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 37, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.03.012", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4394590207", "publication_year": 2024, "score": 0.7448863983154297, "title": "A novel collaborative agent reinforcement learning framework based on an attention mechanism and disjunctive graph embedding for flexible job shop scheduling problem"}, {"abstract": "Iterative learning control (ILC) is a high-performance control design method for systems working in repetitive manner and has seen many applications in practice.

The dipole is fabricated using vias in a standard PCB process to fit at the phone or tablet edges featuring wideband operation with broad half-power beamwidth in the elevation plane (HPBWELEV), high gain and high front-to-back radiation ratio (F/B). For enhanced gain, parasitic-vias are added in front of the dipole as directors. To improve HPBW without sacrificing gain, the directors are implemented as V-shaped bisection parasitic-vias. A via-fence surrounds the dipole structure to suppress back radiation and enhance F/B. The dipole is connected to a parallel-strip line (PS) which is interfaced to the main SIW feed through a novel SIW-to-PS transition. Thorough investigation, optimization, and parametric study are provided for each design parameter of the proposed structure. A single dipole, 2 x 1, and 4 x 1 arrays were designed and fabricated showing close agreement between the simulated and measured results.

By integrating computer vision, ultrasonic sensors, machine learning-based prediction models, and 3D simulation, the digital twin continuously collects time data from the shop floor, estimates cycle times, simulates operations, generates production schedules, virtually mirrors operations in real time, and enables the generation of updated schedules based on actual progress.

After the welding process, the current methods to clean the welding seams lack quality control and adaptability. This increases rework, cost, and the waste produced in manufacturing and is largely due to the use of CNC cutting machines, as well as the reliance on manual inspection and weld seam cleaning. Dealing with manufacturing imperfections becomes a challenging task, as CNC machines rely on predetermined cleaning paths and frame information. To tackle such challenges using Industry 4.0 approaches and automation technology, such as robots and sensors, in this paper, a novel intelligent system is proposed to increase the process capacity to adapt to variability in weld cleaning conditions while ensuring quality through a combined approach of robot arms and machine vision that replaces the existing manual-based methods. Using edge detection to identify the window position and its orientation, artificial intelligence image processing techniques (Mask R-CNN model) are used to detect the window weld seam and to guide the robot manipulator in its cleaning process. The framework is divided into several modules, beginning with the estimation of a rough position for the purpose of guiding the robot toward the window target, followed by an image processing and detection module used in conjunction with instance segmentation techniques to segment the target area of the weld seam, and, finally, the generation of cleaning paths for further robot manipulation. The proposed robotic system is validated two-fold: first, in a simulated environment and then, in a real-world scenario, with the results obtained demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed system. The evaluation of the proposed framework shows that the trained Mask R-CNN can locate and quantify weld seams with 95% mean average precision (less than 1 cm).", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4389187911", "publication_year": 2023, "title": "Vision-Based Guiding System for Autonomous Robotic Corner Cleaning of Window Frames"}, {"abstract": "The construction industry lags behind other sectors in terms of productivity performance, with many megaprojects experiencing cost overruns. While there are various reasons for this, the most significant one is the lack of efficiency. Adopting the off-site construction (OSC) methodology can improve productivity by enhancing project efficiency mainly in terms of time, cost and quality. Although OSC, off-site manufacturing (OSM), Industrialized Building System (IBS), prefabrication, modular, or other similar terms are not novel concepts, it is essential to shift any aspect of construction project activity from traditional onsite methods to a controlled, factory-based and manufacturing concept of production. Industrialization and digital fabrication have gained significant prominence in recent years, as they are perceived as a viable solution to the issues faced by the construction sector. As OSC is gradually gaining interest in building projects, it is crucial to identify and validate the key decision support factors (KDSFs) for selecting an appropriate OSC method from the early design stage. The purpose of this study is to identify, verify, and evaluate the KDSF for selecting OSC in Canada. This study utilized a mixed-methods design, comprising a systematic literature review (SLR) and pilot expert reviews through semi-structured interviews and surveys, to accomplish the research objectives and ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. Twelve interviews were conducted to validate and analyze the KDSFs, which were then prioritized using the mean score (MS) analysis and weighting function. Based on the research methodology, 32 KDSFs were validated and grouped into 7 'dimensions'. Further analysis concluded that the most important 'dimension' in selecting OSC for a building project in Canada is project time which consists of the design period, production time, mobilization and transfer time, as well as the assembly, and construction periods.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4387380925", "publication_year": 2023, "title": "Identification and Evaluation of the Key Decision Support Factors for Selecting Off-site Construction in Canada: A Building Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled Approach"}, {"abstract": "Accurate process planning is essential for successfully implementing offsite construction projects.

Moreover, other content-based methods that consider visual properties of construction images are limited to utilizing simple visual features of the entire image. This poses a challenge when attempting to retrieve target images from the same construction site or those involving similar construction activities, particularly considering that construction images often share similar visual properties.

Although there are numerous benefits inherent to the OSC approach, practitioners still struggle to provide tailored projects to their clients due to the low level of flexibility in production caused by uncertainty, multiple projects, and variable market demands. Indeed, the lack of production flexibility limits shop floors to manufacture projects efficiently in an ever-changing environment, especially when processes are still labor-intensive and are not leveraged by autonomous systems, such as a digital twin (DT). Hence, this paper proposes the use of a DT to improve production on OSC shop floors by increasing flexibility, i.e., the ability to adapt to uncertainty, through the automated reassignment of multiskilled workers based on data pertaining to production status that are updated in near real-time. The present study presents key metrics adopting a lean thinking approach for waste identification that quantifies the improved production performance attributable to the proposed DT. Using simulation as a surrogate system, this research evaluates the production performance on the shop floor according to different simulated scenarios varying the number of interventions made by the DT and multiskilling configurations.

To reduce the exposure to these risks, an investigation of the physical demands that workstations impose on workers' bodies is needed. Since traditional methods used to collect human body motions have limitations, such as workplace interruptions and biased results due to subjective observation, this paper proposes a virtual reality (VR)–motion capture (MOCAP)-based ergonomic assessment method to evaluate ergonomic risks in a laboratory setting during the design phase of workstation development. It is expected that the number of iterations of physical workstation prototypes would be reduced if ergonomic risk ratings are identified proactively in the initial phases of workstation design, which would thereby reduce the cost and time required to develop and implement an improved workstation design. The present study includes a feasibility analysis of the proposed method in which participants representative of specific percentiles of the population based on their physical stature were invited to voluntarily participate in a research experiment. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully simulate the elemental motions, referred to as therbligs, of reaching and positioning (Pearson's correlation coefficient is found to equal 0.80 and 0.94, respectively), while the simulation of the assembling therblig requires further investigation. The contribution of this study is a virtual reality–motion captured-enabled ergonomic risk assessment method applied to workstation design for offsite construction production lines.

Operating a crane is a complex and demanding task that requires careful coordination between operator and signalmen in order to avoid errors that could have dire consequences, including serious injury or loss of life. Therefore, special considerations should be taken to mitigate communication errors that could occur between the two parties. Technology can play an important role in enhancing communication, and, with recent advancements in technology, human–computer interaction has emerged as an active area of research within the field of computer vision. This paper presents a framework that integrates the YOLOv4 model (for object detection) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model (a recurrent neural network) for dynamic hand signal classification in real time. The first step is the creation of a crane signalman dynamic hand signal data set with 18 classes. The YOLOv4 model is then customized for this application by modifying the activation function. Three modified YOLOv4 models are then integrated with the LSTM model. The modified YOLOv4 integrated with LSTM is found to achieve a maximum overall accuracy of 94.8% with an inference time of 55.1 frames per second. The model is further validated with real-time dynamic hand signal classification, achieving an accuracy of 93.5% and an inference time of 44 frames per second.

However, as a drainage system ages, its pipes gradually deteriorate at rates that vary based on the conditions of utilization. To prevent unexpected failures, municipalities have adopted a proactive approach that relies on regular condition assessments of their assets. At this juncture, a question that needs to be answered is how these assessment data can be used to optimize the frequency of inspections of the drainage pipes. In fact, when the assessment information is used in conjunction with deterioration models, city managers are able to develop data-driven maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement plans based on the current condition of the assets and their risk of failure. As a result, understanding the rate at which defects evolve over time provides valuable information in terms of understanding the relationship between the various factors affecting defect development and pipe deterioration. This research presents an image registration framework for extracting crack development information from closed-circuit television (CCTV) videos of sewer pipes. Image processing techniques are used to estimate the relative change for a given defect from images taken at two different times. Because the parameters of cameras (e.g., model, location, angle of view) are generally not expected to be identical for consecutive inspection campaigns, the images to be compared were first scaled using a technique referred to as the area scaler (AS) to ensure all images have the same frame of reference.

The simulation model was built on existing data from current machinery, enabling users to modify design parameters and machine logic without incurring costs associated with prototyping. The simulation results were then analyzed from performance and cost perspectives to decide on the final design parameters. The redesign of the wood framing support systems was found to be almost 40% less costly and more than 10% more productive than currently available systems, showcasing the importance of simulation within the field of construction automation.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3023994195", "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Simulation-Driven Design of Wood Framing Support Systems for Off-Site Construction Machinery"}, {"abstract": "The construction industry is increasingly adopting off-site construction to achieve better quality buildings, to reduce the environmental impact of construction activities, and to attain less schedule variability.When shifting the construction process to a factory, the project is less vulnerable to uncertainties, such as unexpected weather conditions, labour turnover, and material delivery disturbances.Panelized construction is a method in which walls, floors, and roofs are built-in panels at the factory and shipped for on-site assembly.This paper describes the simulation of a production line in a panelized modular home manufacturing facility with the aim of better understanding and improving the production processes associated, in particular, with the first phase of production, namely the multiwall panel production line.Discrete event simulation (DES) is used to investigate and analyze the existing facility processes in terms of production time.The goal is to enhance productivity, reduce work-in-progress, and decrease idle time.The panelized manufacturing facility in the presented study produces dozens of multiwall panels per day, ranging in length from 3 to 13 meters, and both interior and exterior walls are produced on the same production line, each having different physical properties.Applying lean concepts and philosophy, the simulation tool is used to explore various scenarios where the idle time can be identified and minimized as much as possible from a practical perspective.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3088971836", "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Integrated Simulation and Lean Approach for Production Line Improvement in a Prefabricated Panelized Homebuilding Facility"}, {"abstract": "Current manual quality control processes in continuous production environments are limited in impact and reliability.

The use of cranes is growing day by day as the project delivery paradigm in construction is increasingly shifting from the old traditional method where projects are built entirely on-site to an off-site approach relying on modularisation. In essence, modularisation proceeds in two steps: (i) breaking down projects into modules that are fabricated in controlled environments, and (ii) shipping these modules to construction sites for assembly using high capacity cranes. In this respect, the safety during crane operation is of an utmost important issue because an error while lifting, carrying, and placing a load, can cause disastrous accidents. One of the major causes of these accidents is due to improper communication between signalman and operator. The technology is advancing but the crane industry is still relying on the old methods for communication which are by hand signal and two-way radio communication system. This paper introduces a conceptual framework to enhance the communication between the signalman and the crane operator. In this framework, a camera fixed on the helmet of the signalman captures a video that is segmented into frames to which mathematical algorithms are applied in order to interpret their content. This digital graphical (pictorial) content is then transcribed into commands that are displayed on the cabin's monitor for the operator whether the latter has a direct line of sight to the signalman or not this will increase the efficiency of the crane operator.

Design/methodology/approach The proposed platform consists of two stages: Stage I or relational model development and Stage II or design evaluation. Stage I is concerned with developing a mathematical model that links design variables (e.g. the R-Value of the building envelope and construction material) with the assessment attributes (e.g. price and carbon emissions). Stage II ensures the fulfillment of the corporation’s goals in maximizing profit and market shares using multi-attribute utility theory. Findings The application of the proposed model on a case study – a single-family house – shows that reducing the selling price of the unit is not always the best marketing strategy builders should pursue to increase their sales and accordingly their profit, as accounting for other attributes (e.g. performance, operational cost and environmental impact) leads to larger changes in the market shares and accordingly in profit. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this research are manifested in the following points: it does not account for the impact of the marketing campaigns on the market shares; it considers the profit as a percentage of the construction cost; and it has not been validated on high-density residential buildings. Practical implications This research provides speculative builders with a platform that allows the objective evaluation of houses’ designs prior to introducing them to the market so builders can increase their market shares and consequently their profit. The proposed platform also contributes to increasing the sustainable performance of the housing industry, as it allows for the assessment of the design against economic, environmental and social attributes concurrently, which ensures a balanced consideration of the built houses on sustainability pillars. Social implications The proposed platform for design evaluation extends the assessment attributes beyond the traditionally considered economic and environmental attributes. By doing so, it assists decision-makers in evaluating the potential social influence of the proposed design and, as a result, reduces the unwanted impact.

To be useful, CCTV video footage needs to be collected according to standards, which make such an operation, time consuming especially when pipes have operational issues like debris or tree roots. In this respect, developing benchmarks for data collection can be an important source of information that can improve the efficiency of future surveying campaigns. Computer simulation is an effective method for improving the efficiency of maintenance work schedules. However, CCTV collection data consists of abundant noise (waiting time or defect inspection time) due to the characteristics of pipes in different structural or operational conditions. For example, crawlers equipped with CCTV cameras could be blocked by deposits or serious structural issues in the pipe, which would cost some waiting time for the crawler to proceed with the inspection. In order to extract the standard CCTV collection time, excluding waiting time and defect inspection time a machine learning based approach is proposed in this work in the form of an algorithm commonly known as the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). This algorithm is developed to clean the data automatically, arriving at a function of CCTV collection time with two variables (i.e., length of pipe segment and number of taps in the pipe). The results can be fed into a simulation model to imitate the CCTV collection work in future research.

These characteristics strongly depend on the valence states of Mo in the oxides such as IV, V, and VI, which can be efficiently altered through oxygen deficiencies within the oxides. Here, we present a colloidal electrodeposition method to introduce oxygen vacancies in such Mo oxide films. We prepared uniform MoO <sub>x</sub> films and investigated their electrochemical characteristics under different valence states IV, V, and VI. In this paper, we demonstrate that MoO<sub>2+ x</sub> films, where Mo in valence states IV and V, can be used for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. Due to their high conductivity, they exhibit an areal capacitance of 89 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and negligible capacitance loss within 600 cycles. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in a complementary electrochromic device configuration, the introduction of an MoO<sub>2+ x</sub> counter electrode remarkably lowers the activation potential of WO<sub>3</sub> from -2 to -0.5 V and achieves a fully bleached state at 0.5 V. These properties make the MoO<sub>2+ x</sub> film an ideal counter electrode to store ions for an electrochromic device. Furthermore, MoO<sub>3- y</sub> films, where Mo in the valence states V and VI, are obtained by annealing the electrodeposited MoO<sub>2+ x</sub> film under 200 °C for 24 h. Such films exhibit an excellent catalytic for the HER with an overpotential of 201 mV. Furthermore, we show that MoO<sub>3</sub> films, where Mo at its highest oxidation state (VI), can be obtained via annealing the MoO<sub>2+ x</sub> film at 300 °C for 6 h, and the resulting films exhibit battery characteristics.

Such features make the electrochromic battery technology the most promising technology for energy‐efficient electrochromic displays.

However, manual work continues to exist in complex assembly projects, which can potentially cause quality issues. To address such quality issues in industrialized manufacturing processes, projection-based augmented reality (AR) techniques have been applied in other industries (e.g., manufacturing), but on a smaller scale and at a short distance. To apply projection-based AR in the construction manufacturing facility, this paper proposes a framework that enables the user to perform a vision-based projection alignment using a projector and camera. The designated projection area determined by the user is marked out, the coordinates of which are then computed through segmentation and object-detection algorithms. After the acquisition of the markers' coordinates is complete, a two-dimensional (2D) image is overlaid on the surface of the designated area using a projector by computing transformation matrix for the projection. To evaluate the potential performance in a field setting, the offset distances between the four corners of the projection boundary and the center of the markers are measured in various environments, such as at distances ranging from 5 to 8 m, and with different illumination conditions (i.e., low and high brightness) as well as in a manufacturing shop. The results indicate that average offset distances in all the experimental conditions are shorter than the factory tolerance level of 6.35 mm. Also, the statistical analysis reveals that both the distance and the illumination are significant factors affecting the projection alignment performance.

One important consideration in the implementation of automation is the training and maintenance of the equipment. This study proposes an approach to assess the training for assembly/disassembly and maintenance of machines developed for the construction manufacturing industry by using immersive virtual reality (VR). The application of VR allows the collection of data such as the time required to complete the task, the distance travelled, the identification of ergonomic risks (e.g., awkward body posture), and the layout effectiveness, as well as the observation of multiple users performing an identical task under laboratory circumstances. Moreover, VR significantly reduces the costs associated with real mock-ups and the time required for implementation as it allows testing machine designs in a virtual environment that mimics the machine's real operation setting. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study (i.e., VR experiment) is conducted. The primary objective of the case study is to use VR to assess the effectiveness of training using the VR environment for maintenance, and the complexity of the task (i.e., the amount of time needed to understand the task). The VR experiment is performed inside an office room dedicated exclusively for that purpose where participants can move freely, and interactions with the virtual environment are possible through the utilization of a headset and wireless controllers. During the experiment, information is collected both by manual observation and automatic extraction of data from the computer. Based on the analyses of the data collected, the average time to complete the task is determined, and potential areas of design improvement are identified.

Still, automated code compliance checking has not yet been fully realized, as there is no standardized method for rule interpretation and building model preparation for code compliance. Manual verification of design code compliance, meanwhile, requires significant effort and time and is error-prone, while uncertainty and inconsistency in assessment lead to delays in the construction process. In this paper, the development of a prototype to automate municipal bylaw and wall framing code compliance checking for residential building is presented. The building rules have been classified into three groups based on the complexity involved in translation into computer-readable format and complexity in retrieving the required information, and they are represented based on building objects, which makes the regulations easier to understand and assists in translating the regulations into a computer-readable format. By creating a model view based on the required element's parameters extracted from a model for checking purposes, the prototype application offers automated code compliance checking functionality to validate designs based on building code requirements and construction engineering specifications.

Masonry walls are one of the key building components of a Huizhou building; however, the traditional Huizhou masonry wall structure, predominantly a hollow brick structure, cannot meet the local building energy code requirements, and thus needs to be improved. Within this context, the present research measures the actual thermal performance of traditional Huizhou masonry walls for historical buildings and new-built buildings, which results in mean thermal transmittances of 1.892 W/m2·K and 2.821 W/m2·K, respectively, while the local building energy code requires a minimum thermal transmittance of 1.500 W/m2·K. In order to improve the thermal performance of traditional Huizhou masonry walls, four design scenarios for wall insulation are proposed and tested in a climate chamber: (1) hollow brick wall with inorganic interior insulation mortar, (2) solid brick wall with inorganic interior insulation mortar, (3) hollow brick wall with foamed concrete, and (4) hollow brick wall with foamed concrete plus inorganic interior insulation mortar. The experiment results indicate that, among the four proposed design scenarios, only scenario 4 can significantly improve the thermal performance of Huizhou masonry walls and meet the building energy code requirements, with a mean thermal transmittance of 1.175 W/m2·K.

Methodologies exist in the design of automated modular construction machines. This automation consists of not only the machines but also the supportive electrical and pneumatic systems, which, regardless of the design approaches used for automated machines, can be applied to the design of their associated systems.

However, these methods are time-consuming and require human subjects to actually perform the motion in order to obtain detailed body movement data. 3D visualization, alternatively, allows users to simulate an operational task on the computer screen, a process that is less time-consuming and which eliminates the need for costly on-site devices, as well as the detrimental effect of human error during experimentation. It can also proactively visualize a proposed design prior to implementation in the real world. This paper presents an automated ergonomic risk assessment framework based on 3D modelling with the support of a user-friendly interface for data-post processing. 3ds Max is utilized together with its built-in MAXScript. The presented system enables the automation of body motion risk identification by detecting awkward body postures, evaluating the handled force/load and frequency that cause ergonomic risk during body movements of workers. As the outcome, it provides detailed risk scores for body segments, such that users are able to review the continuous motion and corresponding risk by precise time frame. The capability of this 3D visualization-based ergonomic risk assessment can be extended to support the re-design of the workplace and optimization of human body movement accordingly. The ultimate goal of this study is to proactively mitigate ergonomic risk and further reduce potential injuries and workers compensation insurance costs in the long term.

Modular construction has benefitted from the long term development of the manufacturing technologies and core techniques used in the assembly production lines of construction prefabrication plants. Lean production is a methodological approach for assembly line production that aims to eliminate waste, minimize inventory, and maximize production flow. This research proposes implementation of lean concepts through combined discrete-event and continuous simulation approaches with the aim of increasing the productivity of a modular construction element. The proposed model incorporates a simulation of the system reliability by modeling various problems detected within the production line, such as double-handling. Applying continuous simulation facilitated attaining optimal threshold by detecting the inventory level. In addition, improvements are implemented within the model, such as introducing advanced alternatives for the automated stations and adding parallel stations to increase productivity. The effect of proposed production line improvement, along with each station improvement are examined and investigated.

In construction, there is an increasing trend toward buildings being manufactured off-site rather than through traditional stick-built methods on site. This trend has created a demand for construction companies to subcontract work and to seek new efficiencies in their operations. In reference to the production line, regardless of how hard an employee works, there are certain limitations that impede a worker's productivity. To reduce or remove these limitations, many companies have begun to implement Lean methodologies in order to reduce waste in the production process. However, before improving the productivity of the production line, an analysis of the entire manufacturing process must be conducted. This paper introduces the methodologies that can be used to evaluate the production process on both weekly and monthly bases to ensure a consistent productivity rate; this research can be implemented in a variety of manufacturing settings. As a case study, it is implemented at Fortis LGS Structures Inc., an Edmonton-based offsite construction company that produces light gauge steel wall panels; Fortis has been working closely with researchers at the University of Alberta to identify areas of waste and improvements which can be implemented to help increase the productivity of future projects.

Panelized construction is an increasingly popular off-site construction method in which components are panels fabricated off-site then transported to the site for assembly. Panels are manufactured at a rate that exceeds that of on-site assembly of the panels, which necessitates inventory management of the fabricated panels awaiting transportation to the site for assembly. Effective inventory management is thus required in panelized construction to reduce costs. The randomness of the manufacturing and assembly process entails processing a large amount of information iteratively in order to select the proper production scenario to effectively manage the inventory. In this context, simulation provides an appropriate means of testing proposed scenarios in a timely manner. Simulation models require precise information, and building information modeling (BIM) provides a convenient and comprehensive means of data exchange among different environments. This paper thus presents a combination of discrete-event and continuous simulation that uses the information extracted from the BIM model to facilitate inventory management for panelized construction.

The efficiency of on-site construction practice is contingent upon the effectiveness of the specific model used to communicate information. Architects use CAD models to develop a project design, while construction engineers use management tools and spreadsheets to assist in project estimating control and integration. Today, the efficiency of this process is dependent upon the ability of project participants to interpret these discipline-specific models in order to form mental pictures of a proposed design and manually perform material take-offs and estimating. This process contributes to misinterpretation and subsequent estimating errors. Advanced computer tools can be used to prepare smart designs which integrate these models and coordinate the cross-disciplinary tools used for design and cost estimating. The research described in this paper is intended to support the industrialized (manufactured) construction process of residential buildings, coordinating cross-disciplinary knowledge through the utilization of building information modelling (BIM)-based 3D-paremateric modelling.

However, a lack of tools for identifying potential ergonomic risks in a proposed workplace design has led to difficulties in integrating safety and health into workplace design practice.

Industrial construction sites are frequently congested, a condition that reduces the area where cranes can freely maneuver. As a result, in some cases mobile cranes may not have sufficient clearance to perform the lifts and thus need to pick and walk with loads to a point from which the modules can ultimately be set in their resting positions. Since this type of crane operation presents higher risks of failure or accident in comparison to the traditional scenario, in which the location of the crane does not change for the duration of the lifting, a detailed analysis of these operations is paramount to ensure safety and efficiency. Paradoxically, many practitioners still rely on their best judgment for crane walking planning, which in the case of highly congested and complex construction sites is likely to lead to inefficiencies and errors since numerous obstacles may interfere with the crane body and the load. Furthermore, manual analysis is tedious, time-consuming and cannot respond rapidly to changes in work orders or project scope, especially considering the large number of lifts involved in modern industrial projects.

Nevertheless, these tools are each developed only for one particular aspect of construction management, such as scheduling or cost estimating. As such, most are still limited to the product element level, rather than the construction operation level. This paper thus presents a BIM-based integrated framework for detailed cost estimation and schedule planning of construction projects. In the proposed framework, a BIM product model developed in Autodesk Revit, is integrated with a construction process model retrieved from RS Means, with the objective of generating detailed cost estimation and a workface construction schedule simultaneously. In this paper, the literature pertaining to BIM, cost estimating and scheduling is surveyed; then, the proposed framework is presented, and a simple building project is used as a case study to facilitate understanding of and verify the applicability of the integrated framework.

The panelized construction approach is one of the most readily utilized off-site construction methods. In a wood-frame panelized construction plant, wall panels are customized according to various design parameters such as length; height; number of studs, windows, and doors; panel type; and number of walls. These design parameters affect the processing time at each station in the plant, while the panel sequence affects the waiting time between stations. Due to this dynamic nature of the fabrication process, it is challenging to automatically generate an optimal panel sequence, as a result this task is performed manually in current practice. This paper focuses on integrating discrete-event simulation (DES) with an optimization algorithm in order to automate the panel sequencing process. Processing time at each station is calculated based on a task time formula which is a function of the design parameters of the panel, while delay is calculated based on a distribution derived from historical data. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is integrated with the simulation model using a central database in order to generate an optimal panel sequence. The proposed method will eliminate the manual work required for panel sequencing, and is expected to reduce production time up to 10%. The proposed method is implemented in a wood-frame panelized construction plant as a case study.

The modules are produced in an off-site facility and transported on transport trailers to the construction site where they are lifted by mobile cranes. One of the keys to the success of modular industrial projects is efficient crane planning, which includes path checking to find whether or not a crane has a feasible path through which to lift a module over obstructions in a congested plant. However, due to the large number of lifts, the manual path-checking practice is quite tedious and prone to error. In light of this problem, this paper proposes a methodology for automatically checking the lift paths for industrial projects. The proposed methodology simplifies and represents the three-dimensional site layout using project elevations. For each elevation, the crane feasible operation range (CFOR) is calculated based on the crane's capacity and clearances, as well as site constraints. The pick area (PA) is calculated by subtracting the ground obstruction areas from the CFOR. The relative positions of the module's set point, the CFOR, and the PA are checked to determine the feasibility of the lift path on each elevation, as well as the project elevation combination. This approach has been fully automated for path checking of entire sites, and the results are responsive to site changes over time as a project progresses.

The ICOOPMA series arose from a need for such a conference for those researchers who sought a truly international conference that covered a wide range of materials and applications in optics, optoelectronics and photonics. One of the goals is to provide discussions between re‐searchers working on different classes of materials that have similar applications; or have been character‐ized by similar techniques. The conference has a large number of invited speakers to allow such cross‐fertilization between researchers working on different classes of materials. The conference also seeks papers in interesting or novel applications, or papers that enhance material properties for applications. The In‐ternational and Local Organizing Committees have the responsibility of ensuring an in‐depth scientific coverage with invited and contributed papers from various countries and in various disciplines; and en‐suring an enjoyable scientific program. The Second ICOOPMA was held in London, England, 29 July–3 August 2007, and had over 250 participants, and five plenary lectures. The Third ICOOPMA was held in Edmonton, Canada, 20–25 July 2008, and again had nearly 250 participants and had seven plenary talks. TRLabs in Edmonton was responsible for organizing and man‐aging the conference and there were a number of ma‐jor sponsors without whom this conference would not have had the success it deserves. We thank TRLabs for their organization, and our sponsors for their gra‐cious contributions and commitment to the ICOOPMA. There were three parallel oral sessions from Monday to Thursday, and a poster session on Tuesday to cover all the 300 papers. The current Pro‐ceedings represent a collection of papers that have been presented at the conference, and have been fully refereed for inclusion in the proceedings. With the agreement of the journal's Chief Editor and the authors, a selection of papers have been transferred to physica status solidi (a) 206 (5) (May 2009). The papers in both issues cover not only topics on fundamental concepts, including various optical properties (luminescence being the most popular) of a wide class of materials, e.g. organics, glasses, semi‐conductors, nanocrystals, quantum wells, wires and dots etc., but also a number of interesting applications from photonics modulators to X‐ray detectors. There were four best poster prizes that were given during the conference to J. E. Cunningham and Edmund Lin‐field et al. (University of Leeds, UK) on “Terahertz imaging and spectroscopy using on‐chip systems”; Shabnam Homampour et al. (McMaster University, Canada) on “Thermal tuning of planar Bragg gratings in silicon‐on‐insulator rib waveguides”; Mamiko Kujiraoka et al. (National Institute of Information and Commu‐nications Technology, Japan) on “Ensemble effect on Rabi oscillations of exciton in quantum dots”; Osamu Kojima et al. (Kobe University, Japan) on “Lengthening of photoluminescence decay time owing to expansion of electron envelope functions in stacked quantum dots”. Timely publication of conference papers in an easily accessible journal is one of the attractions in presenting one's latest work at conferences. It allows the work to appear relatively quickly after it has been discussed at the conference. The papers in the proceedings were therefore prepared in publica‐tion‐ready form. However, it is also important to en‐sure that proper refereeing has been done before a paper has been accepted. We specifically allowed pa‐per submissions to continue well after the conference date to ensure that the papers included discussions during the conference. We thank the many referees who have unselfishly dedicated their valuable time in reviewing some ninety‐five manuscripts and, in many cases, reviewing the revised versions as well. We are grateful to the editorial team at Wiley‐VCH, in par‐ticular Stefan Hildebrandt in Berlin, for their help in getting the proceedings out as soon as possible once the refereeing of the papers were complete (© 2009 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

tremendous impact not only in the field of natural language processing but also in other fields. The transformer-based language models have contributed to a renewed interest in commonsense knowledge due to the abilities of deep learning models. Recent literature has focused on analyzing commonsense embedded within the pre-trained parameters of these models and embedding missing commonsense using knowledge graphs and fine-tuning. We base our current work on the empirically proven language understanding of very large transformer-based language models to expand a limited commonsense knowledge graph, initially generated only on visual data. The few-shot-prompted pre-trained language models can learn the context of an initial knowledge graph with less bias than language models fine-tuned on a large initial corpus. It is also shown that these models can offer new concepts that are added to the vision-based knowledge graph. This two-step approach of vision mining and language model prompts results in the auto-generation of a commonsense knowledge graph well equipped with physical commonsense, which is human commonsense gained by interacting with the physical world. To prompt the language models, we adapted the chain-of-thought method of prompting. To the best of our knowledge, it is a novel contribution to the domain of the generation of commonsense knowledge, which can result in a five-fold cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art. Another contribution is assigning fuzzy linguistic terms to the generated triples. The process is end to end in the context of knowledge graphs. It means the triples are verbalized to natural language, and after being processed, the results are converted back to triples and added to the commonsense knowledge graph.", "cited_by_count": 2, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14081715", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4292409471", "publication_year": 2022, "score": 0.7107386589050293, "title": "Utilizing Language Models to Expand Vision-Based Commonsense Knowledge Graphs"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 0, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-024-10570-5", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4403539235", "publication_year": 2024, "score": 0.7076044082641602, "title": "Bridging the language gap: an empirical study of bindings for open source machine learning libraries across software package ecosystems"}, {"abstract": "Automated analysis for engineering structures offers considerable potential for boosting efficiency by minimizing repetitive tasks. Although AI-driven methods are increasingly common, no systematic framework yet leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic structural analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with structural analysis software. LLMs serve as the core engine: they parse structural descriptions from text and translate them into executable Python scripts. Moreover, the framework integrates the generative capabilities of LLMs with code-based finite element (FE) tools like OpenSeesPy. It employs domain-specific prompt design and in-context learning strategies to enhance the LLM's problem-solving capabilities and generative stability, enabling fully automated structural analysis from descriptive text to model outputs. In our experiments, we introduce a well-curated small-scale benchmark dataset of 20 structural analysis word problems (SAWPs) with ground-truth solutions and evaluate the performance of different LLMs within our framework in solving these SAWPs. The role of system instructions, crafted by structural engineers, is also investigated to understand their impact on LLM-driven structural analysis. Additionally, the generative stability of our framework is examined. Through multiple validation experiments on the benchmark, our results demonstrate that the proposed framework can substantially increase the level of automation in solving SAWPs compared to traditional methods. Quantitatively, the framework, built on GPT-4o, achieved 100% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4 (85%), Gemini 1.5 Pro (80%), and Llama-3.3 (30%) on the test examples. Furthermore, integrating domain-specific instructions enhanced performance by 30% on problems with asymmetrical structural configurations.", "cited_by_count": 0, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2504.09754", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4415158109", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7050738334655762, "title": "Integrating Large Language Models for Automated Structural Analysis"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 0, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5561189", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4414789095", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7007355690002441, "title": "Structuring Safety Knowledge from Job Hazard Analyses: An Evaluation of Large Language Model–Generated Knowledge Graphs"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 103, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2022.102642", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4220933002", "publication_year": 2022, "score": 0.6972236633300781, "title": "Data-driven method to learning personalized individual semantics to support linguistic multi-attribute decision making"}, {"abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment &amp; operation, and system architecture &amp; orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains.

Interestingly, certain types of phonotactic co-occurrence restrictions found in natural languages may hold across any amount of intervening material. For example, the Samala (Chumash) language of Southern California exhibits a pattern of sibilant harmony, such that [s] and [ʃ] may not co-occur anywhere within the same word (e.g. /ha-s-xintila-waʃ/ becomes [ha-ʃ-xintila-waʃ] `his former gentile name'; Applegate, 1972). Long-distance dependencies like this, despite being relatively common cross-linguistically, are known to pose serious problems for learnability. A learner needs an enormous amount of computational power to discover an interaction in an unbounded search space defined by arbitrary distances, resulting in patterns that are not learnable in practice. Their existence in natural languages thus suggests that humans are equipped with cognitive learning biases that restrict the available hypothesis space and facilitate the learning of patterns with certain properties but not others. This dissertation presents a series of artificial language learning studies that support the hypothesis that the typology of locality relations in long-distance consonantal phonotactics is shaped, at least in part, by such biases. From a theoretical perspective, the goal is to explore and define the boundaries of the human learner's hypothesis space for phonotactic patterns. I argue that the seemingly simple constraints used in the Agreement by Correspondence framework (Rose and Walker, 2004; Hansson, 2010; Bennett 2013) generate many pathological patterns that are unattested cross-linguistically. By contrast, the properties of locality observed for patterns of long-distance consonant agreement and disagreement belong to a well-defined and relatively simple class of subregular formal languages (stringsets) called the Tier-based Strictly 2-Local languages (TSL₂; Heinz et al., 2011). I therefore argue that class of TSL₂ stringsets offers an excellent approximation of the boundaries of possible, human-learnable phonotactics. More generally, I suggest that the formal-language-theoretic approach can be used to inform phonological theory, allowing for a better understanding of the computational complexity and learnability of predicted patterns.", "cited_by_count": 121, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0228114", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2530326466", "publication_year": 2016, "score": 0.6919445991516113, "title": "Tier-based locality in long-distance phonotactics : learnability and typology"}, {"abstract": "The linguistic turn in management studies (Alvesson & Karreman, 2000) over the last 20 years has produced a surge of work analyzing discourse using a varied toolkit of concepts.

Untangling and studying shared meaning is thus a central task for management research, across inductive, deductive, and abductive modes of inquiry (Edmondson & Mcmanus, 2007). Such advances in computational methods hold great promise for organizational theorists, psychologists, and sociologists in studying the complex, multidimensional data that represent language, practice and meaning.

We examined the effect of PPTg lesions (0.5 μl of 0.1 m NMDA injected bilaterally over 10 min) on the learning of an operant response for opiate reward. In 14 adult male Long–Evans rats, bilateral lesions of the PPTg disrupted the acquisition of responding for intravenous heroin (0.1 mg/kg infused at a rate of 0.25 ml/28 sec) on a fixed ratio-1 (FR-1) schedule of reinforcement. The 12 remaining lesioned animals increased their heroin intake over the acquisition sessions but did not reach the response levels of sham-lesioned animals on the 15th and final session. The sham- and PPTg-lesioned animals that learned the FR-1 task exhibited similar patterns of responding during extinction and reacquisition sessions. When tested on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement, however, PPTg-lesioned animals had lower break points than sham-lesioned animals. Asymmetric lesions, which destroyed the majority of the nucleus in one hemisphere only, did not produce any behavioral deficits. Rats that were lesioned after training also did not show deficits in responding under either FR or PR schedules.

To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.", "cited_by_count": 857, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/infocom41043.2020.9155494", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3047304572", "publication_year": 2020, "score": 0.6637849807739258, "title": "Optimizing Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Reinforcement Learning"}]}

In this work, we improve the negative sampler by integrating the exposure data. We propose to generate high-quality negative instances by adversarial training to favour the difﬁcult instances, and by optimizing additional objective to favour the real negatives in exposure data. However, this idea is non-trivial to implement since the distribution of exposure data is latent and the item space is discrete. To this end, we design a novel RNS method (short for Reinforced Negative Sampler) that generates exposure-alike negative instances through feature matching technique instead of directly choosing from exposure data. Optimized under the reinforcement learning framework, RNS is able to integrate user preference signals in exposure data and hard negatives.

The use of reinforcement learning in distribution network reconfiguration is an inherently sensitive application due to the need to change the states of the switches, which can significantly impact the lifespan of the switches. Consequently, executing this process requires meticulous and deliberate consideration. This study presents a new methodology to analyze and elucidate reinforcement learning-based decisions in distribution network reconfiguration. The proposed approach involves the training of an explainer neural network based on the decisions of the reinforcement learning agent. The explainer network receives as input the active and reactive power of the buses at each hour and outputs the line states determined by the agent. To delve deeper into the inner workings of the explainer network, attribution methods are employed. These techniques facilitate the examination of the intricate relationship between the inputs and outputs of the network, offering valuable insights into the agent's decision-making process.

At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become an effective and important methodology to formulate model-free and realtime energy-management strategies for HEVs and PHEVs. In this article, we describe the energy-management issues of HEVs/PHEVs and summarize a variety of potential DRL applications for onboard energy management. In addition to the control objective and constraints, an elaborate model of the powertrain components is necessary as part of the solution. For example, the modeling of an engine involves the calculation of the fuel consumption, an estimate of efficiency, and the derivation of the torque and angular speed. Also, a computation of efficiency and an expression of the power balance are required for motor modeling. The transfer process of the speed and power from the motor/generator to the final drive is part of the transmission modeling.", "cited_by_count": 227, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/mie.2019.2913015", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2973588514", "publication_year": 2019, "score": 0.6616759300231934, "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Management: Recent Advances and Prospects"}, {"abstract": "The widespread deployment of machine learning applications in ubiquitous environments has sparked interests in exploiting the vast amount of data stored on mobile devices. To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.", "cited_by_count": 857, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/infocom41043.2020.9155494", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3047304572", "publication_year": 2020, "score": 0.6611356735229492, "title": "Optimizing Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Reinforcement Learning"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 6, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2024.110587", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4399284071", "publication_year": 2024, "score": 0.6570587158203125, "title": "Daily electric vehicle charging dataset for training reinforcement learning algorithms"}, {"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to control the assistance level of an upper-limb exoskeleton in real-time based on the electromyo-graphic (EMG) activity of human muscles in 3D point-to-point reaching movements. The proposed autonomous assistive device would enhance the force exertion capability of individuals by resolving major challenges such as identifying scaling factors for personalized amplification of their effort and not requiring lengthy offline training/adjustment periods to perform their manual tasks comfortably. To this end, we employed the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method for rapid learning of the appropriate controller's gain values and delivering personalized assistive torques by the exoskeleton to different joints to assist the wearer in a weight handling task. A nonlinear reward function is defined in terms of the EMG activity level and the position deviation from the destination point to simultaneously minimize the muscle effort and maximize the positioning accuracy. This facilitates autonomous and individualized physical assistance by rapid exploration of reward values and adopting various action gains within a safe range to exploit the ones that maximize the reward. Based on experimental studies on an exoskeleton with soft actuators that we have developed, the proposed DRL method is able to identify the most appropriate assistive gain for each joint of the exoskeleton in real-time for the user with a fast rate of convergence (during the first two minutes). Optimum assistive gains are identified for each degree of freedom (DOF) in a 4 kg weight handling task in 3D space, which required less than 15% of the muscle contraction level (EMG activity).", "cited_by_count": 12, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ismr48347.2022.9807562", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4283691802", "publication_year": 2022, "score": 0.6568093299865723, "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for EMG-based Control of Assistance Level in Upper-limb Exoskeletons"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4408257", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4362500204", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.6556158065795898, "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Real-Time Open-Pit Truck Dispatching System"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4408257", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4362500204", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.6556158065795898, "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Real-Time Open-Pit Truck Dispatching System"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 166, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0091-3057(76)90200-8", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W1982536853", "publication_year": 1976, "score": 0.6541633605957031, "title": "Catecholamines and self-stimulation: Evidence suggesting a reinforcing role for noradrenaline and a motivating role for dopamine"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 0, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2025.1632916", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4411389007", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.6539607048034668, "title": "Editorial: Brain reward and aversion circuits: progress review on current and future breakthroughs"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 97, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)90629-7", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2009735728", "publication_year": 1994, "score": 0.6537308692932129, "title": "Lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus block drug-induced reinforcement but not amphetamine-induced locomotion"}]}

a long period of time) could lead to the sub-optimal performance of a thermal heavy oil recovery process. On the other hand, finding the optimal steam injection strategy (policy) represents a major challenge due to the complex dynamic of the physical phenomenon, i.e., nonlinear, slow, high order, time-varying, and potentially highly heterogeneous reservoirs. To address this challenge, the problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem that has typically been solved using adjoint state optimization and a model-predictive control (MPC) strategy. In contrast, this work presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach in which the mathematical model of the dynamic process (SAGD) is assumed unknown. An agent is trained to find the optimal policy only through continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., numerical reservoir simulation model). At each time step, the agent executes an action (e.g., increase steam injection rate), receives a reward (e.g., net present value) and observes the new state (e.g., pressure distribution) of the environment. During this interaction, an action-value function is approximated; this function will offer for a given state of the environment the action that will maximize total future reward. This process continues for multiple simulations (episodes) of the dynamic process until convergence is achieved. In this implementation, the state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) online policy learning algorithm is employed in which the action-value function is continually estimated after every time step and further used to choose the optimal action. The environment consists of a reservoir simulation model built using data from a reservoir located in northern Alberta. The model consists of one well pair (one injector and one producer) and production horizon of 250 days (one episode) is considered. The state of the environment is defined as cumulative, oil and water production, and water injection and for each time step; three possible actions are considered, i.e., increase, decrease or no change of current steam injection rate; and the reward represents the net present value (NPV). Additionally, stochastic gradient descent is used to approximate the action-value function. Results show that the optimal steam injection policy obtained using RL implementation improves NPV by at least 30% with more than 60% lower computation cost.", "cited_by_count": 28, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/193769-ms", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2904365926", "publication_year": 2018, "score": 0.7034235000610352, "title": "Optimization of Steam Injection for Heavy Oil Reservoirs Using Reinforcement Learning"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 30, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s42947-021-00023-3", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3165686696", "publication_year": 2021, "score": 0.7030668258666992, "title": "Application of Machine Learning for Temperature Prediction in a Test Road in Alberta"}, {"abstract": "Abstract Finding an optimal steam injection strategy for a SAGD process is considered a major challenge due to the complex dynamics of the physical phenomena. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been presented as alternative to conventional methods (e.g., adjoint-optimization, model predictive control) as an effective way to address the cited challenge. In general, RL represents a model-free strategy where an agent is trained to find the optimal policy - the action at every time step that will maximize cumulative long-term performance of a given process- only by continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., SAGD process). This environment is modeled as a Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) and a state must be defined to characterize it. During the interaction process, at each time step, the agent executes an action, receives a scalar reward (e.g., net present value) due to the action taken and observes the new state (e.g., pressure distribution of the reservoir) of the environment. This process continuous for a number of simulations or episodes until convergence is achieved. One approach to solve the RL problem is to parametrize the policy using well-known methods, e.g., linear functions, SVR, neural networks, etc. This approach is based on maximizing the performance of the process with respect to the parameters of the policy. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, after every episode a long-term performance of the process is obtained and the parameters of the policy are updated using gradient-ascent methods. In this work policy gradient is used to find the steam injection policy that maximizes cumulative net present value of a SAGD process. The environment is represented by a reservoir simulation model inspired by northern Alberta reservoir and the policy is parametrized using a deep neural network. Results show that optimal steam injection can be characterized in two regions: 1) an increase or slight increase of steam injection rates, and 2) a sharp decrease until reaching the minimum value. Furthermore, the first region's objective appears to be more of pressure maintenance using high steam injection rates. In the second region, the objective is to collect more reward or achieve high values of daily net present value due to the reduction of steam injection while keeping high oil production values.", "cited_by_count": 1, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/213104-ms", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4379523790", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.7024955749511719, "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Well SAGD Optimization: A Policy Gradient Approach"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 0, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-92870-3_19", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4415543253", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7017946243286133, "title": "Underground Stope Design Under Geological Uncertainty Using Deep Reinforcement Learning"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 6, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2025.122692", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4407626438", "publication_year": 2025, "score": 0.7017803192138672, "title": "A reinforcement learning-based ensemble forecasting framework for renewable energy forecasting"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 0, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4573445", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4386919040", "publication_year": 2023, "score": 0.7016348838806152, "title": "Assessing the Effectiveness of Speed Limit Reduction in Edmonton: A Case Study Analysis"}, {"abstract": null, "cited_by_count": 26, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.051", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W1991139282", "publication_year": 2014, "score": 0.7005295753479004, "title": "Precipitation frequency analysis based on regional climate simulations in Central Alberta"}, {"abstract": "Iterative learning control is a control system design method that is able to achieve high tracking performance by repeatedly executing a task and learning the best input from previous attempts of performing the task.

Our model is outperformed on certain data sets by a model using supervised labeling and contrastive learning.

We examined the effect of PPTg lesions (0.5 μl of 0.1 m NMDA injected bilaterally over 10 min) on the learning of an operant response for opiate reward. In 14 adult male Long–Evans rats, bilateral lesions of the PPTg disrupted the acquisition of responding for intravenous heroin (0.1 mg/kg infused at a rate of 0.25 ml/28 sec) on a fixed ratio-1 (FR-1) schedule of reinforcement. The 12 remaining lesioned animals increased their heroin intake over the acquisition sessions but did not reach the response levels of sham-lesioned animals on the 15th and final session. The sham- and PPTg-lesioned animals that learned the FR-1 task exhibited similar patterns of responding during extinction and reacquisition sessions. When tested on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement, however, PPTg-lesioned animals had lower break points than sham-lesioned animals. Asymmetric lesions, which destroyed the majority of the nucleus in one hemisphere only, did not produce any behavioral deficits. Rats that were lesioned after training also did not show deficits in responding under either FR or PR schedules. These findings suggest that PPTg lesions reduce the rewarding effect of opiates but do not disrupt the ability either to learn an operant response or the response requirements of a PR schedule.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W1914814769", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.18-13-05035.1998", "score": 0.6887145042419434}]}

This paper proposes a comprehensive design and operational planning framework to generate optimum self-healing control actions in a distribution system.

In combination with automation, they promise to provide an effective energy management framework that is fair and brings system-level savings. The cooperative–competitive nature of energy markets calls for multi-agent based automation with learning energy trading agents. However, depending on the dynamics of the agent–environment interaction, this approach may yield unintended behavior of market participants. Thus, the design of market mechanisms suitable for reinforcement learning agents must take into account this interplay. This article introduces autonomous local energy exchange (ALEX) as an experimental framework that combines multi-agent learning and double auction mechanism. Participants determine their internal price signals and make energy management decisions through market interactions, rather than relying on predetermined external price signals. The main contribution of this article is examination of compatibility between specific market elements and independent learning agents. Effects of different market properties are evaluated through simulation experiments, and the results are used for determine a suitable market design. The results show that market truthfulness maintains demand-response functionality, while weak budget balancing provides a strong reinforcement signal for the learning agents. The resulting agent behavior is compared with two baselines: net billing and time-of-use rates. The ALEX-based pricing is more responsive to fluctuations in the community net load compared to the time-of-use. The more accurate accounting of renewable energy usage reduced bills by a median 38.8% compared to net billing, confirming the ability to better facilitate demand response.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4220901430", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2022.100150", "score": 0.7570905685424805}, {"title": "ECS-Grid: Data-Oriented Real-Time Simulation Platform for Cyber-Physical Power Systems", "publication_year": 2023, "cited_by_count": 16, "abstract": "ECS-Grid is the first data-oriented real-time electromagnetic transient simulation platform for cyber-physical power systems (CPPS).

One significant aspect of this issue is the notable increase in net load variability at the grid edge.Transactive energy, implemented through local energy markets, has recently garnered attention as a promising solution to address the grid challenges in the form of decentralized, indirect demand response on a community level. Model-free control approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), show promise for the decentralized automation of participation within this context. Existing studies at the intersection of transactive energy and model-free control primarily focus on socioeconomic and self-consumption metrics, overlooking the crucial goal of reducing community-level net load variability.This study addresses this gap by training a set of deep reinforcement learning agents to automate end-user participation in an economy-driven, autonomous local energy market (ALEX). In this setting, agents do not share information and only prioritize individual bill optimization. The study unveils a clear correlation between bill reduction and reduced net load variability. The impact on net load variability is assessed over various time horizons using metrics such as ramping rate, daily and monthly load factor, as well as daily average and total peak export and import on an open-source dataset.To examine the performance of the proposed DRL method, its agents are benchmarked against a near-optimal dynamic programming method, using a no-control scenario as the baseline. The dynamic programming benchmark reduces average daily import, export, and peak demand by 22.05%, 83.92%, and 24.09%, respectively. The RL agents demonstrate comparable or superior performance, with improvements of 21.93%, 84.46%, and 27.02% on these metrics. This demonstrates that DRL can be effectively employed for such tasks, as they are inherently scalable with near-optimal performance in decentralized grid management.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4404514986", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2024.100446", "score": 0.751563549041748}, {"title": "Smart control interface for robust operation of DG units in grid connected and Islanded modes", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 3, "abstract": "In this paper a flexible distributed generation (DG) control interface is being presents to be used in smart grid applications.

Background Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling chronic disorder worldwide. Prior research utilizing national population samples have reported that members of sexual minorities are at higher risk for depression when compared to heterosexual people. More recent studies have revealed differences in depression risk based on sexual orientation, sexual activity and sex. There have been significant shifts in societal attitudes towards sexual minorities in recent decades. Continuing research into predictors for reporting depression amongst sexual minorities is needed. Methods National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles 2005–2012 were used to identify sexual minority status based on declared sexual orientation and presence of same‐sex sexual activity. Complex samples logistic and multivariate regression models were used to predict depression adjusted for sexual orientation, sexual activity, age, sex, marital status, education, income, race/ethnicity, employment and health status. Results Sexual orientation was not a significant independent predictor of depressive symptoms overall. Gay men reported lower levels of depressive symptoms than heterosexual men. In the sex stratified analyses, men who reported having sex with men were five times more likely to report depressive symptomatology compared to men who reported opposite sex partners (2005–2008 adjusted odds ratios: 5·00; 95% confidence interval: 1·44–17·38; 2009–2012 adjusted odds ratios: 5·10; 95% confidence interval: 1·33–19·54) after controlling for sexual orientation. Conclusions Results of our analyses indicate that homosexually experienced heterosexual men appear to be at highest risk for depression. Furthermore, reported physical health status was a significant independent predictor of depression in all models, suggesting a strong link between physical and mental health.

This dissertation discusses eight studies that: a) examine the consequences of genetic essentialism in various domains; b) expand on the existing theoretical framework of genetic essentialism by supplementing it with attribution theory; and c) attempt to find ways that can mitigate the impact of genetic essentialism.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2752011521", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0228787", "score": 0.5721311569213867}, {"title": "Sex, Gender, and Cardiovascular Health in Canadian and Austrian Populations", "publication_year": 2021, "cited_by_count": 25, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3146267691", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2021.03.019", "score": 0.5689806938171387}, {"title": "Heterology: Towards a transcendental empiricist approach to cultural studies", "publication_year": 1995, "cited_by_count": 10, "abstract": "This thesis begins with a discussion of the question of the possibility of a book like Madness and Civlltzation. It shows that its central problem, a problem I argue it shares with cultural studies generally, namely the philosophical and political problem of the silence of the other - of otherness - is a problem, first of all, of subjectivity not discourse. It does this by demonstrating that its present impossibility as assayed by Derrida is irresolvable within a pan-discursive frame. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nDiscourse, I argue, is a milieu that the emerging subject constitutes as a terrain. It is not the force that constitutes the subject, or gives it life, but the breath it draws. There is no way the subject can exist in a discursive vacuum, but, by the same token, discourse by itself will not produce a subject. I argue, therefore, that priority must once again be given to the question of the formation of the subject. Not for the purpose of reifying the subject, however, but rather to deconstruct it. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe overall aim of this thesis, then, is to develop a form of understanding of subjectivity alert to the particular imperatives of this crucial problem. My principal claim is that it is Deleuze's notion of transcendental empiricism that is, philosophically, the most capable of sustaining the conditions necessary for its rectification. Within this frame, however, it is de Certeau's notion of heterology - I further argue - that is practically capable of rectifying it. It is this combination, then, that renders possible my main argument, which is that our understanding of culture must commence with an understanding of the formation of the subject. My rationale is that in order to escape the disempowering homogenization of pandiscursivity Without thereby lapsing into historicism, what is required is a form of philosophical constructivism: heterology. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nHeterology is the critical apparatus that becomes available when de Certeau's concepts of strategy and tactics are read, as they are here, against the background of Deleuze's notion of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is the product of a doubling of empiricist and transcendental philosophies, each with the other, in such a way as to combine the imperatives of both. What this doubling results in is a constructivist understanding of subjectivity - the constructivist subject is at once passively immanent in a discursive milieu and capable of actively transcending it to acquire sovereignty and agency.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2969892530", "doi": null, "score": 0.5685324668884277}, {"title": "Preface", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4248392929", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-382178-2.00018-3", "score": 0.568138599395752}, {"title": "Basis for Sex-Dependent Outcomes in Acute Coronary Syndrome", "publication_year": 2014, "cited_by_count": 43, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2028510906", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2013.08.020", "score": 0.5671558380126953}, {"title": "Do scientific theories affect men's evaluations of sex crimes?", "publication_year": 2011, "cited_by_count": 33, "abstract": "Abstract Evolutionary psychology accounts of gender differences in sexual behaviors in general and men's sexual aggression, in particular, has been criticized for legitimizing males' sexual misconduct. To empirically assess such critiques, two studies examined how men's judgments of male sex crimes (solicitation of sex from a prostitute; rape) are influenced by exposure to (a) evolutionary psychological theories and (b) social‐constructivist theories. Across two studies, a consistent pattern emerged compared with a control condition (a) exposure to evolutionary psychology theories had no observable impact on male judgments of men's criminal sexual behavior, whereas (b) exposure to social‐constructivist theories did affect judgments, leading men to evaluate sex crimes more harshly. Additional results (from Study 2) indicate that this effect is mediated by perceptions of male control over sexual urges. These results have implications for journalists, educators, and scientists.

Reproducible and precise multicellular structures contribute to robustness of embryonic development by cell-cell communication, morphogenesis and other significant biological events. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as animal model, recently several researches established mechanical models to reconstruct the multicellular structures of this developmental system, in which cells interact via repulsive or attractive potentials inside an ellipsoidal eggshell. However, those models ignored some practical details and lack of test in depth. In this paper, we improved an in silico modeling framework based on previous models by revising formulae of interactive force and applying in vivo experimental information of eggshell shape, cell volume, cell position and cell-cell connection relationship. Cell pairs with and without empirically repeated connection were regarded to have different types of attractive force, which could help stabilize cells into their experimentally observed locations accompanied by correct neighbour relationships. Both previous models and our revised ones were tested, verified and compared to each other.

Listeria monocytogenes, pathogenic bacteria, can move intracellular space using the actin motility system of their host cells. Their transmembrane protein, ActA, can recruit actin polymerization factors of the cell, such as Arp2/3 complex and VASP proteins. Particularly, the ActA proteins localized on the pole surface of the bacteria concentrate actin polymerization on the end point of their bacterial bodies and propel their movement in the direction of both sides creating actin comet tails. Previously, research studies have investigated micro-bead motility test based on the ActA interfacial mechanism in cytoplasm extracts, and artificial motility media that included several actin binding proteins (ABPs), ATP, and ions. We had not only observed actin comet tails with ActA conjugated micro-beads in the minimum essential motility solution but also confirmed that the ActA mediated actin polymerization generated sufficient force for the vesicle protrusion. Here we enclosed the ActA conjugated gold nano-particles with actin motility solution including non-muscle actin, ABPs, ATP, ATP regenerating enzymes, and cations into the liposome. Consequently, we can observe liposome vesicle movement protruding their pseudopodia.

Whether such a structure exists, however, and what its molecular and structural composition are have remained controversial. In this study, using a live-imaging approach in Drosophila syncytial embryos, we demonstrate that nuclear proteins reorganize during mitosis to form a highly dynamic, viscous spindle matrix that embeds the microtubule spindle apparatus, stretching from pole to pole. We show that this “internal” matrix is a distinct structure from the microtubule spindle and from a lamin B–containing spindle envelope. By injection of 2000-kDa dextran, we show that the disassembling nuclear envelope does not present a diffusion barrier. Furthermore, when microtubules are depolymerized with colchicine just before metaphase the spindle matrix contracts and coalesces around the chromosomes, suggesting that microtubules act as “struts” stretching the spindle matrix. In addition, we demonstrate that the spindle matrix protein Megator requires its coiled-coil amino-terminal domain for spindle matrix localization, suggesting that specific interactions between spindle matrix molecules are necessary for them to form a complex confined to the spindle region.

The growth, morphology, and development of halotolerant strain HW-1 shifted in response to salinity. The optimal seawater concentration for growth of HW-1 was 0 to 80% (salinity, 0.1 to 2.9%), and the strain grew poorly in media with a salinity of more than 4%. The cells became shorter as the seawater concentration increased. The fruiting body structure was complete only on agar prepared with low concentrations of seawater or salts (less than 60% seawater; salinity, 2.1%), and rudimentary structures or even simple cell mounds appeared as the seawater concentration increased. In contrast, the halophilic strain SMP-2 was unable to grow without NaCl. The cell length and the morphology of the fruiting body-like structure did not change in response to salts. In seawater liquid medium, the cells of both strains were confirmed to be able to form myxospores directly from vegetative cells, but they could not do so in medium containing a low seawater concentration (10% or less).

METHODS: Participants included 240 self-identified endurance athletes (m=112, f=126, non-binary=1, and preferred not to answer=1) across different sports (cycling=57, running=100, triathlon = 61, other=22; pro=13, current/former collegiate athlete=67, recreational=160). The participants ranged in age from 18 to 79 years old (40.7±13.73) and were primarily white (n=213). Participants completed an online survey through Qualtrics on demographics, recovery strategies used in practice and competition, perceived benefit of the strategy, and their sources of information regarding recovery strategies. RESULTS: Hydration was the most frequently reported recovery strategy in both training (91.3%, n = 219) and competition r (80.4%, n = 193). Nutrition followed in training (78.8%, n = 189) and competition (78.3%, n = 188). Sleep was the third most utilized strategy in training (77.9%, n = 187) and competition (76.7%, n = 184). The least used recovery strategy was ultrasound in training (1.3%, n = 3) and competition (1.7% n = 4). Chi-squared analyses showed no significant differences between training and competition for the use of the recovery strategies. Hydration was reported as a beneficial recovery strategy after practice (96.5%, n = 223) and competition (94.7%, n = 200) by the greatest percentage of participants, with sleep the second most frequently considered beneficial (91.4%, n = 213; 92.5%, n = 199), followed by nutrition (91.3%, n = 211; 92.5%, n = 198).

The cellulolytic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is capable to biosynthesize sorbicillinoids, but the underlying regulatory mechanism is not yet completely clear. Herein, we identified a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, Dim5, in T. reesei . TrDIM5 deletion caused an impaired vegetative growth as well as conidiation, whereas the ∆ Trdim5 strain displayed a remarkable increase in sorbicillinoid production. Post TrDIM5 deletion, the transcription of sorbicillinoid biosynthesis‐related ( SOR ) genes was significantly upregulated with a more open chromatin structure. Intriguingly, hardly any expression changes occurred amongst those genes located on both flanks of the SOR gene cluster. In addition, the assays provided evidence that H3K9 triple methylation (H3K9me3) modification acted as a repressive marker at the SOR gene cluster and thus directly mediated the repression of sorbicillinoid biosynthesis. Transcription factor Ypr1 activated the SOR gene cluster by antagonizing Tr Dim5‐mediated repression and therefore contributed to forming a relatively more open local chromatin environment, which further facilitated its binding and SOR gene expression. The results of this study will contribute to understanding the intricate regulatory network in sorbicillinoid biosynthesis and facilitate the endowment of T. reesei with preferred features for sorbicillinoid production by genetic engineering.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4289638513", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.14103", "score": 0.7202615737915039}, {"title": "Die Phenoloxydasen des Ascomyceten Podospora anserina", "publication_year": 1964, "cited_by_count": 44, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W1964891307", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00408601", "score": 0.7043533325195312}, {"title": "DFF, a Heterodimeric Protein That Functions Downstream of Caspase-3 to Trigger DNA Fragmentation during Apoptosis", "publication_year": 1997, "cited_by_count": 1831, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2082259697", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80197-x", "score": 0.7033872604370117}, {"title": "Apaf-1, a Human Protein Homologous to C. elegans CED-4, Participates in Cytochrome c–Dependent Activation of Caspase-3", "publication_year": 1997, "cited_by_count": 3127, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2144701362", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80501-2", "score": 0.6989564895629883}, {"title": "Dynamic Studies of Scaffold-Dependent Mating Pathway in Yeast", "publication_year": 2006, "cited_by_count": 30, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2123943662", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.106.081661", "score": 0.6955552101135254}, {"title": "A Multi-domain Protein System Based on the H<sub>C</sub>Fragment of Tetanus Toxin for Targeting DNA to Neuronal Cells", "publication_year": 2003, "cited_by_count": 26, "abstract": "One goal of gene therapy is the targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to defined tissues. One attractive target is the central nervous system as there are several neuronal degenerative diseases which may be amenable to gene therapy. At present there is a lack of delivery systems that are able to target genes specifically to neuronal cells. Multi-domain proteins were designed and constructed to facilitate the delivery of exogenous genes to neuronal cells. Neuronal targeting activity of the proteins was achieved by inclusion of the HC fragment of tetanus toxin (TeNT), a protein with well-characterised tropism for the central nervous system. The yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain enabled specific binding of DNA while the translocation domain from diphtheria toxin (DT) was included to facilitate crossing of the endosomal vesicle. One multi-domain protein, containing all three of these domains, was found to transfect up to 8% of neuroblastoma N18-RE105 cells with marker genes. Monitoring the transfection by confocal microscopy indicated that this protein-DNA transfection complex is to some extent localised at the cell surface, suggesting that further improvements to translocating this membrane barrier may yield higher transfection levels.

In cells, human Fidgetin targets to centrosomes, and its depletion with siRNA significantly reduces the velocity of poleward tubulin flux and anaphase A chromatid-to-pole motion.

In this study, we demonstrated that Sit4 and PP2Ac interact with Tap42 via an N-terminal domain that is conserved in all type 2A and 2A-like phosphatases.

To investigate the detailed molecular events controlling this process, the protein profiles of Smad4 mutant and control epidermal and HF keratinocytes were compared using 2‐D difference gel electrophoresis (2‐D DIGE) proteomic analysis. Eighty‐six differentially expressed protein spots were identified by MALDI‐TOF/TOF MS or ESI‐MS/MS as 72 proteins, of which 29 proteins were found to be changed during the anagen‐catagen transition of HFs in Smad4 mutants compared with the controls. The differentially expressed proteins represent a wide spectrum of functional classes such as keratin, the cytoskeleton, cellular growth and differentiation, ion combination and transfer, protein enzymes.

This pathway consists of tumor suppressor putative HLA-DR–associated proteins (PHAP) and oncoprotein prothymosin-α (ProT).

By using electromyography (EMG) electrodes attached to the surface of the skin, amputees are able to control motors in myoelectric prostheses by voluntarily contracting the muscles of their residual limb. This work describes the development of an inexpensive myoelectric training tool (MTT) designed to help upper limb amputees learn how to use myoelectric technology in advance of receiving their actual myoelectric prosthesis. The training tool consists of a physical and simulated robotic arm, signal acquisition hardware, controller software, and a graphical user interface. The MTT improves over earlier training systems by allowing a targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) patient to control up to two degrees of freedom simultaneously. The training tool has also been designed to function as a research prototype for novel myoelectric controllers. A preliminary experiment was performed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the MTT as a learning tool and to identify any issues with the system. Five able-bodied participants performed a motor-learning task using the EMG controlled robotic arm with the goal of moving five balls from one box to another as quickly as possible. The results indicate that the subjects improved their skill in myoelectric control over the course of the trials. A usability survey was administered to the subjects after their trials.

Many techniques for non-invasive grip force feedback are being investigated. However, the choice of force sensor, feedback location, and experimental apparatus typically vary between research studies, making it challenging to compare results. A standardized device where individual parameters can be adjusted would allow researchers to evaluate the impact of each variable on results. An example of such a device is a simulated prosthesis. Simulated prosthesis devices enable non-disabled individuals to participate in myoelectric prosthesis research experiments while ensuring consistency in experimental apparatus between participants. We developed a lightweight, modular, and inexpensive simulated myoelectric prosthesis capable of delivering sensory feedback to fingertips and proximal forearm. We integrated mechanotactile feedback devices to deliver modality matched feedback to the forearm and somatotopically matched feedback to the fingertips. We compared a commercial force sensor before and after being encapsulated within a compliant material under a variety of loading conditions. The encapsulated force sensor outperformed the standard sensor in all non-ideal loading conditions by a large margin. The use of this encapsulation technique dramatically increases accuracy in sensor readings when loading conditions differ from calibration conditions.

Prosthesis functionality was demonstrated over three test sessions; the participant was able to identify tactor stimulation location and demonstrated a reduction in grasp force with the mechanotactile stimulation. This system offers an inexpensive and modular solution for integration of a mechanotactile sensory feedback system into a prosthetic socket without compromising the suction seal.

A lack of wrist movement in prostheses due to mechanical design and control system considerations compels prosthetic users to employ compensatory movements using their upper back and shoulder that can eventually result in strain and overuse injuries. One possible means of easing this control burden is to allow a prosthetic wrist to self-regulate, keeping the terminal device of the prosthesis level relative to the ground when appropriate, such as when raising a cup of liquid. This study aims to outline such a wrist control scheme, and evaluate its function in terms of the effect on compensatory movements, objective system performance, and subjective perception of system performance based on user feedback. To that end, twelve able-bodied participants were recruited to control a body-mounted robotic arm using three different control schemes: fixed-wrist (FW), sequential switching (SS), and automatic levelling (AL). The resulting movement strategies were recorded for two different tasks using 3D motion-capture. SS and AL control schemes induced similar movement strategies and less compensation than FW for horizontal movements, while AL reduced shoulder flexion compared to FW and SS for vertical movements. However, AL was ranked less intuitive and less reliable than the FW. AL and SS both seemed to involve more conscious thought to operate than FW. These results suggest that more complex wrist control schemes may indeed be able to eliminate harmful compensatory movements, but reinforce prior observations that control must be reliable and simple to use or people will opt for an easier system.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2966546613", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/icorr.2019.8779444", "score": 0.7005152702331543}, {"title": "Comparative study of post-impact motion control of a flexible arm space robot", "publication_year": 2022, "cited_by_count": 21, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4294904377", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcon.2022.100738", "score": 0.700477123260498}, {"title": "Initial Investigation of a Self-Adjusting Wrist Control System to Maintain Prosthesis Terminal Device Orientation Relative to the Ground Reference Frame", "publication_year": 2018, "cited_by_count": 4, "abstract": "Lack of adequate wrist control in prostheses forces people with upper limb amputations to use compensatory movements that eventually result in overuse injuries. This is partly because conventional control of myoelectric wrists involves switching between directly controlling the wrist and fixing the wrist relative to the forearm. We propose that by implementing a wrist that is able to maintain the hand's orientation relative to the ground reference frame, here termed a self-adjusting wrist, users may see benefits in terms of both compensatory movements and ease of control. In this design study, we describe a simple initial implementation of a self-adjusting wrist. We then introduce and compare five control methods for the system. These methods were tested with six able-bodied participants who used a desk-mounted robotic arm to perform an object transfer and manipulation task. Quantitative and qualitative analyses coupled with user feedback suggest that a self-adjusting wrist may reduce task completion time and number of control interactions, and increase user satisfaction compared to conventional switching-based control. Our results indicate that use of a momentary switch to toggle a robotic hand's orientation between being fixed to the ground reference frame and being either fixed to the forearm reference frame or employing direct wrist control may be the best choice for a self-adjusting wrist.

Assistive robotics is one prominent area in which foresight of this kind can bring improved quality of life. In this article, we present a new approach to acquiring and maintaining predictive knowledge during the online ongoing operation of an assistive robot. The ability to learn accurate, temporally abstracted predictions is shown through two case studies: 1) able-bodied myoelectric control of a robot arm and 2) an amputee's interactions with a myoelectric training robot. To our knowledge, this research is the first demonstration of a practical method for real-time prediction learning during myoelectric control. Our approach therefore represents a fundamental tool for addressing one major unsolved problem: amputee-specific adaptation during the ongoing operation of a prosthetic device. The findings in this article also contribute a first explicit look at prediction learning in prosthetics as an important goal in its own right, independent of its intended use within a specific controller or system.

The subjects exerted a steady mean flexing force and were instructed not to intervene (i.e., not to resist actively) when force or displacement perturbations were imposed on the forearm. The method was either to reconstruct transmission around the entire loop in a two-part experiment, or to use the attenuation of external perturbations in normal and electrically stimulated muscle to compute gain. Across all experiments, the mean magnitude of stretch reflex OLG was close to unity in the frequency range 1–2 Hz, and declined at higher frequencies, as required to ensure stability, given that the phase lag approached 180° at 5 Hz. Inherent muscle stiffness was approximately equal to reflex stiffness. In functional terms, an OLG of 1 means that the yield caused by a force perturbation is approximately halved by reflex action (prevailing inherent muscle stiffness is doubled). Automatic scaling of reflex transmission at Ia/α-motoneuronal synapses ensures that the OLG remains close to unity as inherent stiffness increases. Trials in the patient with the wrist fixator gave similar results, indicating that the reflexes were proprioceptively mediated. In a fourth experiment in which the task was to catch a heavy ball, we compared the efficacy of inherent muscle stiffness and reflexes alone, with the subject's intentional reactions, which included predictive and voluntary components of response. The latter were far more effective in maintaining the position of the hand after the ball was caught than inherent and reflex stiffnesses alone. We conclude that stability requirements limit the extent to which stretch reflexes can augment inherent muscle stiffness. When inherent muscle stiffness is low, such as in our ball-catching task, the reflex stiffness is also low, and predictive and pre-programmed reactions predominate in load compensation, thus shifting the emphasis from automatic servo or equilibrium-point behaviour to higher order control.Key words: reflexes, muscle stiffness, motor control.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2063283700", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1139/y94-076", "score": 0.5938735008239746}, {"title": "Take to the Old Oven", "publication_year": 1983, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W768441940", "doi": null, "score": 0.5927820205688477}, {"title": "Coupling Clamp", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4236736172", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9751-4_100164", "score": 0.5901713371276855}, {"title": "Coupling Clamp", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4236736172", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9751-4_100164", "score": 0.5901713371276855}, {"title": "Argument &amp; Other Tools to Improve Communication", "publication_year": 2017, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3164524685", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7939/r3-ssm6-pd83", "score": 0.5892620086669922}, {"title": "Darcy’s Law", "publication_year": 2017, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2944008840", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12127-7_79-1", "score": 0.589256763458252}, {"title": "Darcy’s Law", "publication_year": 2018, "cited_by_count": 2, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4249886816", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73568-9_79", "score": 0.5892176628112793}, {"title": "Creep", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4236726788", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9751-4_100165", "score": 0.5889754295349121}, {"title": "Creep", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4236726788", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9751-4_100165", "score": 0.5889754295349121}, {"title": "Creep", "publication_year": 2012, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4236726788", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9751-4_100165", "score": 0.5889754295349121}]}

data. It is a common practice to rely on static maps for required engine torque-fuel efficiency data. The engine dynamics are ignored in these static maps and it is uncertain how neglecting these dynamics can affect fuel economy of a parallel HEV. This paper presents the impact of ICE dynamics on the performance of the torque split management strategy. A parallel HEV torque split strategy is developed using a method of model predictive control. The control strategy is implemented on a HEV model with an experimentally validated, dynamic ICE model. Simulation results show that the ICE dynamics can degrade performance of the HEV control strategy during the transient periods of the vehicle operation by more than 20% for city driving conditions in a common North American drive cycle.

This article presents a large-scale driving status and trajectory dataset consisting of 426,992,602 records collected from 68,069 vehicles over a month. From the dataset, we analyze the driving behavior and produce random distributions of trip duration and millage to characterize car trips.

The collective distributions of trip mileage and duration follow Weibull distribution, whereas the hourly trips follow the well known diurnal pattern and so the hourly fuel efficiency. Based on these findings, we have developed an application which recommends the drivers to find the nearby gas stations and possible favorite places from past trips.

Therefore, recent developments in such vehicle stability control and autonomous driving systems have led to substantial interest in reliable road angle and vehicle states (tire forces and vehicle velocities) estimation. Advances in applications of sensor technologies, sensor fusion, and cooperative estimation in intelligent transportation systems facilitate reliable and robust estimation of vehicle states and road angles. In this direction, developing a flexible and reliable estimation structure at a reasonable cost to operate the available sensor data for the proper functioning of active safety systems in current vehicles is a preeminent objective of the car manufacturers in dealing with the technological changes in the automotive industry.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThis thesis presents a novel generic integrated tire force and velocity estimation system at each corner to monitor tire capacities and slip condition individually and to address road uncertainty issues in the current model-based vehicle state estimators. Tire force estimators are developed using computationally efficient nonlinear and Kalman-based observers and common measurements in production vehicles. The stability and performance of the time-varying estimators are explored and it is shown that the developed integrated structure is robust to model uncertainties including tire properties, inflation pressure, and effective rolling radius, does not need tire parameters and road friction information, and can transfer from one car to another.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe main challenges for velocity estimation are the lack of knowledge of road friction in the model-based methods and accumulated error in kinematic-based approaches. To tackle these issues, the lumped LuGre tire model is integrated with the vehicle kinematics in this research. It is shown that the proposed generic corner-based estimator reduces the number of required tire parameters significantly and does not require knowledge of the road friction. The stability and performance of the time-varying velocity estimators are studied and the sensitivity of the observers' stability to the model parameter changes is discussed. The proposed velocity estimators are validated in simulations and road experiments with two vehicles in several maneuvers with various driveline configurations on roads with different friction conditions. The simulation and experimental results substantiate the accuracy and robustness of the state estimators for even harsh maneuvers on surfaces with varying friction.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nA corner-based lateral state estimation is also developed for conventional cars application independent of the wheel torques. This approach utilizes variable weighted axles' estimates and high slip detection modules to deal with uncertainties associated with longitudinal forces in large steering.

This shortcoming is addressed in this paper by studying effects of engine and clutch dynamics on a parallel HEV control strategy for torque split. To this end, a detailed HEV model including clutch and ICE dynamic models is utilized in this study. Transient and steady-state experiments are used to verify the fidelity of the dynamic ICE model. The HEV model is used as a testbed to implement the torque split control strategy. Based on the simulation results, the ICE and clutch dynamics in the HEV can degrade the control strategy performance during the vehicle transient periods of operation by around 8% in urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) drive cycle. Conventional torque split control strategies in HEVs often overlook this fuel penalty.

Therefore, recent developments in such vehicle stability control and autonomous driving systems have led to substantial interest in reliable road angle and vehicle states (tire forces and vehicle velocities) estimation. Advances in applications of sensor technologies, sensor fusion, and cooperative estimation in intelligent transportation systems facilitate reliable and robust estimation of vehicle states and road angles. In this direction, developing a flexible and reliable estimation structure at a reasonable cost to operate the available sensor data for the proper functioning of active safety systems in current vehicles is a preeminent objective of the car manufacturers in dealing with the technological changes in the automotive industry.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThis thesis presents a novel generic integrated tire force and velocity estimation system at each corner to monitor tire capacities and slip condition individually and to address road uncertainty issues in the current model-based vehicle state estimators. Tire force estimators are developed using computationally efficient nonlinear and Kalman-based observers and common measurements in production vehicles. The stability and performance of the time-varying estimators are explored and it is shown that the developed integrated structure is robust to model uncertainties including tire properties, inflation pressure, and effective rolling radius, does not need tire parameters and road friction information, and can transfer from one car to another.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe main challenges for velocity estimation are the lack of knowledge of road friction in the model-based methods and accumulated error in kinematic-based approaches. To tackle these issues, the lumped LuGre tire model is integrated with the vehicle kinematics in this research. It is shown that the proposed generic corner-based estimator reduces the number of required tire parameters significantly and does not require knowledge of the road friction. The stability and performance of the time-varying velocity estimators are studied and the sensitivity of the observers' stability to the model parameter changes is discussed. The proposed velocity estimators are validated in simulations and road experiments with two vehicles in several maneuvers with various driveline configurations on roads with different friction conditions. The simulation and experimental results substantiate the accuracy and robustness of the state estimators for even harsh maneuvers on surfaces with varying friction.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nA corner-based lateral state estimation is also developed for conventional cars application independent of the wheel torques.

The efficiency is studied and efficiency plots are introduced; predicted losses are used to investigate thermal conditions and temperature rise, which affect the machines described in the paper.

A parallel HEV torque split strategy is developed using a method of model predictive control. The control strategy is implemented on a HEV model with an experimentally validated, dynamic ICE model. Simulation results show that the ICE dynamics can degrade performance of the HEV control strategy during the transient periods of the vehicle operation by more than 20% for city driving conditions in a common North American drive cycle.

Understanding the shedding of droplets from a surface is a critical part of the dropwise condensation process for improving heat transfer. Because gravity as a droplet removal technique is not available in space, the use of airflow to shed droplets is considered for condensing heat exchangers in environmental control and life support systems. Surface coatings affect drop adhesion, and here, four different surfaces (PMMA, PS, PTFE, and SHS) and various droplet sizes (80, 60, and 40 μL) were used to understand the above phenomenon. It was found that the critical velocity to shed a droplet in microgravity was up to 8% lower than that in normal gravity. Also, the effect of the droplet size was investigated for both microgravity and normal gravity; the shedding velocity was lower for microgravity, and it decreased as droplet size increased. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the coating decreased the critical velocity for shedding. Finally, the droplet was found to detach from superhydrophobic surfaces in microgravity. The detachment of droplets from the substrate will hamper the condensation process that can produce a larger fresh area; also, detachment of droplets and entrainment in airflow counter the concept of removing moisture from the air in a dehumidification process.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4313236539", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01898", "score": 0.6632375717163086}, {"title": "Observations of Dust, Ice Water Clouds, and Precipitation in the Atmosphere of Mars", "publication_year": 2008, "cited_by_count": 1, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3028119671", "doi": null, "score": 0.6610088348388672}, {"title": "Solidification of Undercooled Melts of Al-Based Alloys on Earth and in Space", "publication_year": 2017, "cited_by_count": 13, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2623603670", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11837-017-2402-y", "score": 0.6603922843933105}, {"title": "Dendrite growth in undercooled Al-rich Al-Ni melts measured on Earth and in Space", "publication_year": 2019, "cited_by_count": 12, "abstract": "The dendrite growth velocity in Al75Ni25 melts has been measured in a containerless procedure as a function of&#13;\\nundercooling using an electromagnetic levitation technique both in the Earth laboratory and in Space on board the&#13;\\nInternational Space Station.

Metal lead halide perovskites have emerged and been verified to possess many unique properties for optoelectronic applications, which are key elements for the space mission system. However, the basic knowledge of radiation damage of perovskite materials and the in-depth experimental irradiation testing on their lasing properties are still lacking. Here, the performance of a CsPbBr3 nanoplate (NP) laser is measured to be maintained after exposure to 150 keV proton beam with fluence up to 1 × 1015 p/cm2, an extremely high level of collision that destroys CdS NPs with similar shapes and emission wavelengths. Lasing characteristics and carrier dynamics of the CsPbBr3 and CdS NPs have been studied and compared in detail before and after proton irradiation with different beam fluences. Concurrently, simulation results manifest that negligible atomic displacement damage is caused by proton bombardment in CsPbBr3, ensuring its high resistance to proton irradiation. The findings of the high radiation resistance of the CsPbBr3 NP lasers and the insights into the underlying mechanism are conceivably important, which might make recommendations for the development of perovskite coherent light sources for new space applications.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3107040536", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.0c02543", "score": 0.6577248573303223}, {"title": "Modulation of the DNA-damage response to HZE particles by shielding", "publication_year": 2008, "cited_by_count": 38, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2143626289", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dnarep.2008.06.016", "score": 0.6566963195800781}, {"title": "THE ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERIZATION FOR EXPLORATION AND SCIENCE (ACES) INSTRUMENT SUITE FOR MARS.", "publication_year": 2015, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2725616942", "doi": null, "score": 0.656522274017334}, {"title": "H <sub>2</sub> O at the Phoenix Landing Site", "publication_year": 2009, "cited_by_count": 548, "abstract": "Phoenix Ascending The Phoenix mission landed on Mars in March 2008 with the goal of studying the ice-rich soil of the planet's northern arctic region.

greatly from simultaneous application of multiple sensors. For example, combinations of passive radiometers with active sensors such as lidar or radar have proved to be invaluable for their ability to retrieve profiles of cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties. This is amply illustrated by results from both surface sites, such as the US-DoE's ARM installations, and sensors aboard A-train satellites; namely CloudSat, CALIPSO, and Terra. The Earth Clouds, Aerosols, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission, a combined ESA/JAXA endeavor set for launch in 2015, has been designed to host active and passive sensors on a single low-Earth orbit satellite and thus retrieve, through synergistic use of data, the most comprehensive global survey of the vertical structure cloud, aerosol precipitation, and radiation. The mission consists of a cloud-profiling radar, a high-spectral resolution cloud/aerosol lidar, a passive imager, and a threeview broadband radiometer (BBR) covering both longwave and shortwave bands.

Understanding the shedding of droplets from a surface is a critical part of the dropwise condensation process for improving heat transfer. Because gravity as a droplet removal technique is not available in space, the use of airflow to shed droplets is considered for condensing heat exchangers in environmental control and life support systems. Surface coatings affect drop adhesion, and here, four different surfaces (PMMA, PS, PTFE, and SHS) and various droplet sizes (80, 60, and 40 μL) were used to understand the above phenomenon. It was found that the critical velocity to shed a droplet in microgravity was up to 8% lower than that in normal gravity. Also, the effect of the droplet size was investigated for both microgravity and normal gravity; the shedding velocity was lower for microgravity, and it decreased as droplet size increased. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the coating decreased the critical velocity for shedding. Finally, the droplet was found to detach from superhydrophobic surfaces in microgravity. The detachment of droplets from the substrate will hamper the condensation process that can produce a larger fresh area; also, detachment of droplets and entrainment in airflow counter the concept of removing moisture from the air in a dehumidification process.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4313236539", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01898", "score": 0.6559386253356934}, {"title": "THE ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERIZATION FOR EXPLORATION AND SCIENCE (ACES) INSTRUMENT SUITE FOR MARS.", "publication_year": 2015, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2725616942", "doi": null, "score": 0.655817985534668}, {"title": "H <sub>2</sub> O at the Phoenix Landing Site", "publication_year": 2009, "cited_by_count": 548, "abstract": "Phoenix Ascending The Phoenix mission landed on Mars in March 2008 with the goal of studying the ice-rich soil of the planet's northern arctic region.

This article documents this data set and presents analyses of some of the data. The near infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS) investigation obtained 17 separate mosaics of the Moon in 408 spectral channels between about 0.7 and 5.2 μm. The instrument was originally designed to operate in orbit about Jupiter and therefore saturates at many spectral channels for most measurement situations at 1 AU. However, sufficient measurements were made of the Moon to verify the proper operation of the instrument and to demonstrate its capabilities. Analysis of these data show that the NIMS worked as expected and produced measurements consistent with previous ground‐based telescopic studies. These are the first imaging spectrometer measurements of this type from space for the Moon, and they illustrate several major points concerning this type of observation and about the NIMS capabilities specifically. Of major importance are the difference between framing and scanning instruments and the effects of the spacecraft and the scan platform on the performance of such an experiment. The science return of subsequent NIMS and other investigation measurements will be significantly enhanced by the experience and results gained.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2110778010", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1029/93je03434", "score": 0.6469612121582031}, {"title": "Radiation-Resistant CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> Nanoplate-Based Lasers", "publication_year": 2020, "cited_by_count": 21, "abstract": "The use of nanoscale lasers in new space technologies can enable a variety of applications.

However, the basic knowledge of radiation damage of perovskite materials and the in-depth experimental irradiation testing on their lasing properties are still lacking. Here, the performance of a CsPbBr3 nanoplate (NP) laser is measured to be maintained after exposure to 150 keV proton beam with fluence up to 1 × 1015 p/cm2, an extremely high level of collision that destroys CdS NPs with similar shapes and emission wavelengths. Lasing characteristics and carrier dynamics of the CsPbBr3 and CdS NPs have been studied and compared in detail before and after proton irradiation with different beam fluences. Concurrently, simulation results manifest that negligible atomic displacement damage is caused by proton bombardment in CsPbBr3, ensuring its high resistance to proton irradiation. The findings of the high radiation resistance of the CsPbBr3 NP lasers and the insights into the underlying mechanism are conceivably important, which might make recommendations for the development of perovskite coherent light sources for new space applications.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3107040536", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.0c02543", "score": 0.6465845108032227}, {"title": "Small Atmospheric Mars Payload Landed Experiment (SAMPLE): Concept and Modelling", "publication_year": 2019, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3106946259", "doi": null, "score": 0.6462326049804688}]}

Fatty acid (FA) biomarkers are useful for evaluating trophic interactions in aquatic ecosystems because of clear phylogenetic separation of algal group FA signatures. We used a FA-based Bayesian mixing model (FASTAR) to generate quantitative diet estimates of 3 algal phyla for an intertidal herbivorous isopod, Idotea wosnesenskii, at 6 sites in Puget Sound, Washington. We generated a 'resource library' of FA signatures of isopods fed diverse algal diets in 10-wk feeding trials and used these empirical data to parameterize FASTAR, thus accounting for isopod modification of dietary FA. The FA profiles of fast growing juvenile Idotea were closely related to the signatures of their diets, and several polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were highly correlated between diet and consumer (e.g. ΣC18 ω6 + C18 ω3, 20:4ω6, and 20:5ω3). We used the model to characterize individual isopod diet variability within sites and to test whether isopods utilize specific algal phyla preferentially or in similar proportions to algae available in the field. The results identified both variation in resource utilization among individual isopods within certain sites, and site level similarities with total available algal cover. Body mass index of wild isopods was highest at sites where the model indicated high utilization (e.g. >30%) of both green and brown algae and low support from red algae. This novel FA-based mixing model approach demonstrated the potential for quantitative diet estimations of fast-growing aquatic herbivorous consumers.

Despite this evidence, much research demonstrates significant heterogeneity in the amounts that people sleep across cultures. This suggests that despite serving fundamental biological functions, sleep is also subject to cultural influence. Using self-report and actigraphy data we examined sleep among European Canadian, Asian Canadian, and Japanese university students. Significant cultural differences emerged in terms of various parameters of sleep (e.g. sleep time), and beliefs about sleep (e.g. perceived relation between sleep and health). Despite sleeping significantly less than European Canadians, Japanese participants slept less efficiently, yet reported being less tired and having better health. Moreover, relative to European Canadians, Japanese participants perceived a weaker relation between sleep and physical health, and had a significantly shorter ideal amount of sleep. Asian Canadians’ sleep behaviors and attitudes were largely similar to European Canadians suggesting that people acculturate to local cultural sleep norms.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3159574360", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250671", "score": 0.6534929275512695}, {"title": "Aerosol Characterisitics Over Alberta Using Modis and OMI Satellite Data", "publication_year": 2015, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2757529800", "doi": null, "score": 0.6472992897033691}, {"title": "The new GeoREF geotechnical beam centrifuge at the University of Alberta, Canada", "publication_year": 2013, "cited_by_count": 2, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2497706296", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1201/b16200-15", "score": 0.6472721099853516}, {"title": "The new GeoREF geotechnical beam centrifuge at the University of Alberta, Canada", "publication_year": 2013, "cited_by_count": 2, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2497706296", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1201/b16200-15", "score": 0.6472721099853516}, {"title": "Networked Optimization, Diagnosis, and Estimation Laboratory at the University of Alberta [Its Research Lab]", "publication_year": 2025, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4408858320", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/mits.2025.3526319", "score": 0.6448674201965332}, {"title": "The Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta 1) Cube-Satellite Mission", "publication_year": 2020, "cited_by_count": 13, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3044399599", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-020-00720-8", "score": 0.6405153274536133}, {"title": "The Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta 1) Cube-Satellite Mission", "publication_year": 2020, "cited_by_count": 13, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3044399599", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-020-00720-8", "score": 0.6405153274536133}, {"title": "The Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta 1) Cube-Satellite Mission", "publication_year": 2020, "cited_by_count": 13, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3044399599", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-020-00720-8", "score": 0.6405153274536133}, {"title": "The Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta 1) Cube-Satellite Mission", "publication_year": 2020, "cited_by_count": 13, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3044399599", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-020-00720-8", "score": 0.6405153274536133}, {"title": "The Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta 1) Cube-Satellite Mission", "publication_year": 2020, "cited_by_count": 13, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3044399599", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-020-00720-8", "score": 0.6405153274536133}, {"title": "TYPE 2 MI IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA: A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS", "publication_year": 2014, "cited_by_count": 15, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2024097406", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2014.07.254", "score": 0.6393961906433105}, {"title": "Analyzing and visualizing the canadian research landscape.", "publication_year": 2019, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3023966062", "doi": null, "score": 0.6384806632995605}, {"title": "Examination of human interaction on indoor environmental quality variables: A case study of libraries at the University of Alberta", "publication_year": 2021, "cited_by_count": 25, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W3210889264", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108476", "score": 0.6380271911621094}, {"title": "Northern SPIRIT Consortium - Canadian Collaboration through Student-Led CubeSat Constellation", "publication_year": 2021, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": "The Northern Space Program for Innovative Research and Integrated Training (Northern SPIRIT) is a unique collaboration of three Canadian post-secondary institutions that will design, build, and operate a constellation of three CubeSats.

A sample of 471 Mainland Chinese aged 18 or older completed an online survey that collected information on demographics, experience, cognition, and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health condition. Mental health condition was assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) for the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of Mainland Chinese during the pandemic. Moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress levels were respectively reported by 11.30%, 10.83%, and 5.10% of respondents. Univariate analysis of variance models (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess mental health condition variance as stratified by independent sociodemographic- or COVID-19-related explanatory variables, to identify possible predictors to be entered into the subsequent regression models. The regression models identified age, income level, health status, and perceived discrimination as significant sociodemographic predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.19–7.11, ps &lt; 0.05), whereas self-infection worry, attitude towards Canadian measures, information confusion, food/goods stocking, and room cleaning/sanitizing were identified as significant COVID-19-reltaed predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.33–3.45, ps &lt; 0.05) for mental health outcomes.

In this context, this study aimed to assess non-pathological psychological distress towards COVID-19 and identify its sociodemographic risk factors among Mainland Chinese in Canada at the early stages of the pandemic. Methods: A sample of 731 Mainland Chinese aged 16 or older completed an on-line survey to examine their attitudes, behavioural, and psychological responses towards COVID-19. Non-pathological psychological distress was assessed with a 7-item self-report scale to capture common emotional reactions towards COVID-19. Results: A factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure of the 7-item COVID-19 psychological distress scale (Eigen λ = 3.79). A composite psychological distress index (PDI) score was calculated from these items and used as the outcome variable. Multivariate regression models identified age, financial satisfaction, health status, and perceived/experienced discrimination as significant predictors of psychological distress (ps ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Mainland Chinese in Canada who were over 25, in poor financial/health status, or with perceived/experienced discrimination were at a higher risk for COVID-19-related psychological distress.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in early 2021 with a sample of 899 Chinese Canadians (i.e., immigrants, citizens, visitors, and international students) during the Wave 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, anti-Chinese discrimination was generally associated with younger age and poor financial or health status. Christianity/Catholicism believers were less likely to report perceived discrimination, whereas being married/partnered and living with family reduced the incidences of experienced discrimination. Most importantly, hierarchical linear regression models showed that both perceived and experienced discrimination predicted higher psychological distress (<b><i>β</i></b>s = 4.90-7.57, <i>p</i>s ≤ .001) and loneliness (<b><i>β</i></b>s = .89-1.73, <i>p</i>s ≤ .003), before and after controlling for all related sociodemographic covariates.

Mental health condition was assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) for the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of Mainland Chinese during the pandemic. Moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress levels were respectively reported by 11.30%, 10.83%, and 5.10% of respondents. Univariate analysis of variance models (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess mental health condition variance as stratified by independent sociodemographic- or COVID-19-related explanatory variables, to identify possible predictors to be entered into the subsequent regression models. The regression models identified age, income level, health status, and perceived discrimination as significant sociodemographic predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.19–7.11, ps &lt; 0.05), whereas self-infection worry, attitude towards Canadian measures, information confusion, food/goods stocking, and room cleaning/sanitizing were identified as significant COVID-19-reltaed predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.33–3.45, ps &lt; 0.05) for mental health outcomes.

In this context, this study aimed to assess non-pathological psychological distress towards COVID-19 and identify its sociodemographic risk factors among Mainland Chinese in Canada at the early stages of the pandemic. Methods: A sample of 731 Mainland Chinese aged 16 or older completed an on-line survey to examine their attitudes, behavioural, and psychological responses towards COVID-19. Non-pathological psychological distress was assessed with a 7-item self-report scale to capture common emotional reactions towards COVID-19. Results: A factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure of the 7-item COVID-19 psychological distress scale (Eigen λ = 3.79). A composite psychological distress index (PDI) score was calculated from these items and used as the outcome variable. Multivariate regression models identified age, financial satisfaction, health status, and perceived/experienced discrimination as significant predictors of psychological distress (ps ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Mainland Chinese in Canada who were over 25, in poor financial/health status, or with perceived/experienced discrimination were at a higher risk for COVID-19-related psychological distress.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in early 2021 with a sample of 899 Chinese Canadians (i.e., immigrants, citizens, visitors, and international students) during the Wave 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, anti-Chinese discrimination was generally associated with younger age and poor financial or health status. Christianity/Catholicism believers were less likely to report perceived discrimination, whereas being married/partnered and living with family reduced the incidences of experienced discrimination. Most importantly, hierarchical linear regression models showed that both perceived and experienced discrimination predicted higher psychological distress (<b><i>β</i></b>s = 4.90-7.57, <i>p</i>s ≤ .001) and loneliness (<b><i>β</i></b>s = .89-1.73, <i>p</i>s ≤ .003), before and after controlling for all related sociodemographic covariates. Additionally, older age, higher education, better financial or health status could all buffer psychological distress, whereas living with family or in a house and better financial or health status could mitigate feeling of loneliness.

Using self-report and actigraphy data we examined sleep among European Canadian, Asian Canadian, and Japanese university students. Significant cultural differences emerged in terms of various parameters of sleep (e.g. sleep time), and beliefs about sleep (e.g. perceived relation between sleep and health). Despite sleeping significantly less than European Canadians, Japanese participants slept less efficiently, yet reported being less tired and having better health. Moreover, relative to European Canadians, Japanese participants perceived a weaker relation between sleep and physical health, and had a significantly shorter ideal amount of sleep.

At one level, risk is about numbers and information. But at another level, risk is about narratives and meanings. In this paper, we describe four risk perspectives: technical, economic, perceptual, and cultural. Technical and economic perspectives inform techno-economic approaches to risk, whereas perceptual and cultural perspectives inform socio-cultural approaches to risk. We argue that understanding energy and environmental risks requires consideration of information and meaning, and numbers and narratives. We illustrate these perspectives with a brief case study of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster and consider Canadian energy development debates. The discussion suggests that risks within and across societies—whether at a given point in time, or dynamically over time—can be more fully explained by going beyond techno-economic conceptualizations of risk through consideration of socio-cultural issues.

In this paper, we describe four risk perspectives: technical, economic, perceptual, and cultural. Technical and economic perspectives inform techno-economic approaches to risk, whereas perceptual and cultural perspectives inform socio-cultural approaches to risk. We argue that understanding energy and environmental risks requires consideration of information and meaning, and numbers and narratives. We illustrate these perspectives with a brief case study of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster and consider Canadian energy development debates. The discussion suggests that risks within and across societies—whether at a given point in time, or dynamically over time—can be more fully explained by going beyond techno-economic conceptualizations of risk through consideration of socio-cultural issues.

A sample of 471 Mainland Chinese aged 18 or older completed an online survey that collected information on demographics, experience, cognition, and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health condition. Mental health condition was assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) for the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of Mainland Chinese during the pandemic. Moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress levels were respectively reported by 11.30%, 10.83%, and 5.10% of respondents. Univariate analysis of variance models (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess mental health condition variance as stratified by independent sociodemographic- or COVID-19-related explanatory variables, to identify possible predictors to be entered into the subsequent regression models. The regression models identified age, income level, health status, and perceived discrimination as significant sociodemographic predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.19–7.11, ps &lt; 0.05), whereas self-infection worry, attitude towards Canadian measures, information confusion, food/goods stocking, and room cleaning/sanitizing were identified as significant COVID-19-reltaed predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.33–3.45, ps &lt; 0.05) for mental health outcomes.

In this context, this study aimed to assess non-pathological psychological distress towards COVID-19 and identify its sociodemographic risk factors among Mainland Chinese in Canada at the early stages of the pandemic. Methods: A sample of 731 Mainland Chinese aged 16 or older completed an on-line survey to examine their attitudes, behavioural, and psychological responses towards COVID-19. Non-pathological psychological distress was assessed with a 7-item self-report scale to capture common emotional reactions towards COVID-19. Results: A factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure of the 7-item COVID-19 psychological distress scale (Eigen λ = 3.79). A composite psychological distress index (PDI) score was calculated from these items and used as the outcome variable. Multivariate regression models identified age, financial satisfaction, health status, and perceived/experienced discrimination as significant predictors of psychological distress (ps ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Mainland Chinese in Canada who were over 25, in poor financial/health status, or with perceived/experienced discrimination were at a higher risk for COVID-19-related psychological distress.

Overall, anti-Chinese discrimination was generally associated with younger age and poor financial or health status. Christianity/Catholicism believers were less likely to report perceived discrimination, whereas being married/partnered and living with family reduced the incidences of experienced discrimination. Most importantly, hierarchical linear regression models showed that both perceived and experienced discrimination predicted higher psychological distress (<b><i>β</i></b>s = 4.90-7.57, <i>p</i>s ≤ .001) and loneliness (<b><i>β</i></b>s = .89-1.73, <i>p</i>s ≤ .003), before and after controlling for all related sociodemographic covariates.

A sample of 471 Mainland Chinese aged 18 or older completed an online survey that collected information on demographics, experience, cognition, and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health condition. Mental health condition was assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) for the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of Mainland Chinese during the pandemic. Moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress levels were respectively reported by 11.30%, 10.83%, and 5.10% of respondents. Univariate analysis of variance models (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess mental health condition variance as stratified by independent sociodemographic- or COVID-19-related explanatory variables, to identify possible predictors to be entered into the subsequent regression models. The regression models identified age, income level, health status, and perceived discrimination as significant sociodemographic predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.19–7.11, ps &lt; 0.05), whereas self-infection worry, attitude towards Canadian measures, information confusion, food/goods stocking, and room cleaning/sanitizing were identified as significant COVID-19-reltaed predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.33–3.45, ps &lt; 0.05) for mental health outcomes.

In this context, this study aimed to assess non-pathological psychological distress towards COVID-19 and identify its sociodemographic risk factors among Mainland Chinese in Canada at the early stages of the pandemic. Methods: A sample of 731 Mainland Chinese aged 16 or older completed an on-line survey to examine their attitudes, behavioural, and psychological responses towards COVID-19. Non-pathological psychological distress was assessed with a 7-item self-report scale to capture common emotional reactions towards COVID-19. Results: A factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure of the 7-item COVID-19 psychological distress scale (Eigen λ = 3.79). A composite psychological distress index (PDI) score was calculated from these items and used as the outcome variable. Multivariate regression models identified age, financial satisfaction, health status, and perceived/experienced discrimination as significant predictors of psychological distress (ps ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Mainland Chinese in Canada who were over 25, in poor financial/health status, or with perceived/experienced discrimination were at a higher risk for COVID-19-related psychological distress. The health inequity across these factors would inform the services to mitigate mental health risk in minority groups.", "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W4309744294", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112326", "score": 0.6558041572570801}, {"title": "Determinants of changes in dietary patterns among Chinese immigrants: a cross-sectional analysis", "publication_year": 2011, "cited_by_count": 102, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2121359407", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-42", "score": 0.6551809310913086}, {"title": "SPACEBORNE METHANE OBSERVATIONS BY AIRS OVER ALBERTA", "publication_year": 2015, "cited_by_count": 0, "abstract": null, "openalex_url": "https://openalex.org/W2750739379", "doi": null, "score": 0.653597354888916}, {"title": "What to Study in China?

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in early 2021 with a sample of 899 Chinese Canadians (i.e., immigrants, citizens, visitors, and international students) during the Wave 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, anti-Chinese discrimination was generally associated with younger age and poor financial or health status. Christianity/Catholicism believers were less likely to report perceived discrimination, whereas being married/partnered and living with family reduced the incidences of experienced discrimination. Most importantly, hierarchical linear regression models showed that both perceived and experienced discrimination predicted higher psychological distress (<b><i>β</i></b>s = 4.90-7.57, <i>p</i>s ≤ .001) and loneliness (<b><i>β</i></b>s = .89-1.73, <i>p</i>s ≤ .003), before and after controlling for all related sociodemographic covariates. Additionally, older age, higher education, better financial or health status could all buffer psychological distress, whereas living with family or in a house and better financial or health status could mitigate feeling of loneliness.
